<p>My KCC – the portal at <a href="https://my.kcc.edu">my.kcc.edu</a>  – has a new look for an improved user experience for KCC's students, employees and retirees who have college accounts.</p>

<p>It is three-columns on personal computers, and the information is in a different order. The re-ordering of content puts links to important information in an easy-to-see location at the top left.</p>

<p>For those using a smart device, such as a cell phone, the order of information is new as well.</p>

<p>The changes were made after feedback received from various users, plus the portal taxonomy team. The group is made up of people from around the college who gave input into what to include and where to include it.</p>

<p>The new portal page includes a feedback option as well to get input from all those who use it.</p>
