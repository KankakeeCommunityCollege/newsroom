<p>For the remainder of the summer term, the KCC Food Pantry has created two different grab and go food packs for students. </p>

<p><img src="/uploads/gng-food-sm.png" alt="" class="float-image-left" width="350" height="262" />The first is a snack pack of three snack items, the second is a lunch pack with a shelf stable lunch item and two snacks.  All are packaged in clear bags so students can see what they are getting.</p>

<p>Grab &amp; Go food is available in KCC Room W102 and the Welcome Center from 8 a.m. - 6 p.m.,  Monday - Friday.</p>
