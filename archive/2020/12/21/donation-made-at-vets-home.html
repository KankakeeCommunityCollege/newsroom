<p>This project was made possible through a partnership with <a href="http://projectheadspaceandtiming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Headspace and Timing</a>, a local organization run by Eric Peterson (KCC '12) which is dedicated to enhancing veterans' mental health and well-being.</p>
