<p>We are just a few weeks away from the Spring 2021 semester at KCC. Here are some updates and helpful pieces of information:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/celebration-celebrate-yay-26FL4fdR9oRs2tdEA/fullscreen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Let's celebrate</a> students for making it through the semester! You should be proud of your persistence!</li>
  <li>Looking ahead, we sincerely hope that COVID-19 does not derail your educational goals. KCC is dedicated to helping you stay on track. Spring classes begin Jan. 11. Class options are in-person, online (live online, and online "on your time"), plus classes that are a little bit of both–called hybrid. </li>
  <li>If you want to talk to your advisor about registering, it isn't too late. We've opened up more <a href="https://kccadvising.setmore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advisement appointments</a>. Phone 815-802-8500 or email <a href="mailto:advising@kcc.edu">advising@kcc.edu</a>. We can talk about the best options for you. See below for holiday hours.</li>
  <li>Avoid lines and order textbooks online using the <a href="https://books.kcc.edu/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KCC Hammes Bookstore webstore</a>. Either preorder books for pickup or have them sent directly to your home. Payment can be from your financial aid or use a credit card. </li>

The <a href="https://www.kcc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a> and <a href="https://my.kcc.edu/staff/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">student portal</a> wont' be taking a break. College offices re-open at 8 a.m. Jan. 4. </li>

Most services are free.</li>
  <li>If you've already registered for Spring: That's great! We're looking forward to seeing you in-person or through a virtual-yet-still-interactive format.</li>
