<p>KCC will offer 18 online learning classes for kids this summer.</p>

<p>“These one-week classes give kids a chance to connect with other kids and actively engage their minds this summer,” said Mary Posing, KCC’s assistant dean of continuing education and career services. “The classes are very fun, all while building skills in technology.”</p>

<p>KCC has teamed up with Black Rocket, a company with 20 years of experience presenting classes focused on 21st century skills, to offer these at-home learning opportunities.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.kcc.edu/newsroom/2020/esports-kcc-kidstem-sm.jpg" alt="" class="float-image-right" width="350" height="175" />All of the options are available to kids ages 8-14. Each class meets online for a week, Monday through Friday. New classes start every week from June 22 to Aug. 3.</p>

<p>Each “KidSTEM” class has immersive activities guided by live, online instructors. Plus, there is a moderated Virtual Room for kids to engage with the instructor and interact with other participants.</p>

<p>Descriptions and registration is online at <a href="https://www.enrole.com/kcc/jsp/index.jsp" target="_blank">enrole.com/kcc</a>. Search by title or for KidSTEM. Each description has a notation about compatible operating systems and if extra equipment—such as a webcam—is required. A technical specifications sheet is also available. <img src="https://cdn.kcc.edu/newsroom/2020/minecraft-animators-kcc-kidstem-sm.jpg" alt="" class="float-image-right" width="350" height="175" /></p>
