<p>Five athletic teams at Kankakee Community College have earned recognition from the NJCAA for academic achievements the 2019-20 academic year.</p>

<p>“We are very proud of the academic performance of our student athletes,” said Todd Post, KCC’s athletic director. “Having to move to all online classes midway through the spring semester was a big adjustment for everyone in the academic area. I praise the athletes for their dedication to their course work.”</p>

<p>The minimum team grade point average requirement is 3.0 to receive recognition. KCC’ teams qualifying for NJCAA All-Academic Team status are:</p>

<p>• Softball – 3.6 team GPA, and six students with GPAs above 3.0;<br />• Baseball – 3.06 team GPA, and six students with GPAs above 3.6;<br />• Women’s Basketball – 3.03 team GPA, and four students with GPAs above 3.6;<br />• Volleyball – 3.5 team GPA, and six students with GPAs above 3.6; and<br />• Soccer – 3.21 team GPA and three students with GPAs above 3.6.</p>

<p>The overall grade point average of KCC student-athletes was 3.17 for the year.</p>
