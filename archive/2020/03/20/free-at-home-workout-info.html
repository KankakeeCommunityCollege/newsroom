<p>Life Fitness, the company that outfitted the KCC FItness Center, has made a limited time offer of free at-home workouts to KCC students and staff.</p>

<p>"It's important while you are staying in place to keep exercising from home," said Donnie Denson, KCC's assistant athletic director. "They have offered some great tips and routines for everyone."</p>

<p>The free workout link is essentially a temporary free trial for our partners, said Life Fitness representative Justin Mundt. "It will eventually become subscription-based, but it will require action from you and you will not be auto-signed up."</p>
