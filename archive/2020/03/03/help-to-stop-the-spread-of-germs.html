<p>Amid the worry and concern, please use common-sense preventive actions. They include: Stay home if youâ€™re sick, cover coughs and sneezes, clean frequently touched surfaces, and wash your hands often.</p>

<p>The Centers for Disease Control recommends washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available. More resources are on the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/index.html" target="_blank">CDC website</a>.</p>

<p>Especially relevant during spring travel: The CDC also has <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/after-travel-precautions.html" target="_blank">advice for travelers</a>. It includes staying home for 14 days from the time you leave an area with widespread or ongoing community spread of coronavirus.</p>
