<p><img src="https://cdn.kcc.edu/newsroom/2020/virtual-club-rush-403-graphic.jpg" alt="" class="float-image-left" width="350" height="350" />Students are invited to join in, start up or support a Student Club this fall.</p>

<p>Participation builds leadership skills; helps you pursue an academic, social or special interest; and lets you go beyond your classes to meet other students and staff.</p>

<p>Students in clubs and organizations not only gain excellent leadership and learning experiences, but are more likely to succeed in college.</p>

<p>Get started during the virtual Club Rush/Club Fair and see how you can get involved and get connected.<br />6 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 1, 2020 and<br />6 p.m. Wednesday, Sept. 2, 2020</p>

<p>Prizes will be available for student attendees.<br />The meeting link is <a href="https://meet.google.com/kur-uanb-cur" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://meet.google.com/kur-uanb-cur</a></p>
