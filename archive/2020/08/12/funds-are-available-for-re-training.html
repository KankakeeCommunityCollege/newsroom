<p><img src="https://cdn.kcc.edu/newsroom/2020/opportunity-just-ahead-sq.png" alt="" class="float-image-right" width="350" height="293" />Short-term training and credentials are tools people have in the path to finding employment.<br /><br />The Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act is funded so qualified job seekers receive up $10,000 toward training, plus $2,500 for books/supplies per program year.<br /><br /><a href="https://wioa.kcc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WIOA</a> can provide scholarship opportunities for those who lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, said Mary Posing, Kankakee Community College assistant dean of continuing education and career services.<br /><br />It is a time of career opportunity, with jobs and education available, especially in the area of manufacturing, Posing said.<br /><br />“The manufacturing industry is in desperate need of trained workers,” said Mark Anderson, KCC’s director of manufacturing training. “Every week I receive emails and phone calls from local manufacturers looking to fill positions in welding,<br />machine tool, industrial maintenance, and logistics. Recently, I have been receiving emails and phone calls from manufacturers as far north as Cook County looking for trained welders and maintenance technicians. The number of manufacturing jobs available outnumber the qualified applicants. Now is a wonderful time to get trained to add to your resume or move up within your company.”<br /><br />A <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/manufacturing/articles/future-of-manufacturing-skills-gap-study.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018 study</a> by one of the world’s largest accounting and professional services organizations, Deloitte, showed that 2.4 million manufacturing positions could be unfilled by 2028. There were 488,000 open jobs in manufacturing at the time of the study.<br /><br />There also are people in Kankakee County who need jobs, said Posing, citing the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/eag/eag.il_kankakee_msa.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 2020 jobless rate</a> of 13.5% for the county.<br /><br />“Using WIOA funds for short-term training at KCC gives people a number of choices for local employment,” Posing said. “Funding is available to train people for in-demand occupations. It can be done. And it can be done without the student going into debt.”<br /><br />Enrollment in WIOA as a dislocated worker does not affect unemployment benefits.<br /><br />KCC offers a Manufacturing Technology program with four specializations that lead to credentials offered by organizations like <a href="https://www.msscusa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manufacturing Skills Standards Council</a>.<br /><br />“I’ve had students recently complete the two-year Manufacturing Technology AAS degree and move into management position within their company,” Anderson said. “I also have students who are right out of high school who have completed a short 14 credit hour Manufacturing Production Certificate which helped them receive high paying job offers with local manufacturers within weeks.”<br /><br />“Manufacturers in the United States are experiencing some of the highest levels of growth we’ve seen in decades, yet the industry seems unable to keep up with the resulting rebound in job growth,” said Paul Wellener, vice chairman of Deloitte LLP. “With nearly 2 million vacant new jobs expected by 2028, compounded by 2.69 million vacancies from retiring workers, the number of open positions could be greater than ever and might pose not only a major challenge for manufacturers but may threaten the vitality of the industry and our economy.”<br /><br />The WIOA program offers career training assistance up to $10,000 for tuition Eligibility is open to the groups, following WIOA definitions: dislocated workers, low-income adults and youth. Enrollment in WIOA as a dislocated worker does not affect unemployment benefits.<br /><br />For more information, visit <a href="https://wioa.kcc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wioa.kcc.edu</a> and click “<a href="https://wioa.kcc.edu/service-eligibility-questionnaire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Get Started</a>,” email <a href="mailto:wiaoffice@kcc.edu">wiaoffice@kcc.edu</a> or phone 815-802-8963.</p>
