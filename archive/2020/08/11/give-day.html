Every gift will have a direct and immediate impact on KCC students.”<br /><br />The three giving priorities of this fundraising event are: The Emergency Technology Fund; the Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Center Fund; and the Emergency Assistance Fund.<br /><br />For Fall 2020, KCC is offering classes online, in-person and a combination of in-person and online. The Emergency Technology Fund will enable current KCC students with the technology needed for online/remote learning. <br /><br />Currently in the planning stages, the Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Center Fund will help establish a safe, inclusive and affirming space for the entire campus community. The center will create a climate of intentional interaction and collaboration that will foster critical thinking, expand awareness of sensitive topics and increase the overall cultural competency of students, and college employees, Myers said.<br /><br />The Emergency Assistance Fund supports KCC students experiencing extreme financial hardship that threatens to halt their education.<br /><br />To donate, visit <a href="https://www.kcc.edu/giveday" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kcc.edu/giveday</a>.
