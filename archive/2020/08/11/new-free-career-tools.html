<p>Kankakee Community College has added a free interactive tool to its website that helps students and prospective
  students find careers that match their interests.<br /><br />The software, called Career Coach, tailors career
  options for users based on questions about themselves. The personalized results include career titles, labor market
  data and academic programs that could lead to those jobs. The software can also be used to build resumes and connect
  to job openings locally and regionally.<br /><br />Career Coach is free and is available for anyone to
  use.<br /><br />KCC partnered with the <a

  >Economic Alliance of Kankakee County</a>, the <a
    href="https://www.cfkrv.org/"

    href="https://www.kacc-il.org/"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"
  >Kankakee Area Career Center</a> to bring the tool to the community.<br /><br />“A tool like this helps filter the
  career options and choose a path that fits,” said Matthew Kelley, director of the Kankakee Area Career Center. “That’s
  really beneficial, because choosing a career can be a roadblock for some students.”<br /><br />“Career Coach uses a
  personalized approach,” said Lesley Cooper, director of Institutional Effectiveness &amp; Assessment at KCC. “This
  instrument starts with questions about the user’s preferences and interests. Then, it helps them explore what careers
  are a good fit for those strengths and interests. So, it’s customized for each person.”<br /><br />“With the global
  market undergoing such significant transformation, it’s essential that we clearly connect the dots for job seekers
  regarding their career options and relevant training,” said Tim Nugent, president and CEO of the Economic Alliance of
  Kankakee County. “Demand skills are evolving rapidly. Career Coach is a powerful tool that takes a lot of the mystery
  out of the workforce readiness process, providing personalized information about career matches as well as local
  training and job opportunities."<br /><br />To access Career Coach, go to <a
    href="https://www.kcc.edu/"
