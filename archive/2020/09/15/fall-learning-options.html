<p>Educational and fun courses for adults over age 55 will be offered this fall as part of the Kankakee Community
  College Lifelong Learning Institute.</p>
</p>The Lifelong Learning Institute offers affordable, high-quality
  non-credit classes that take place in an environment that fosters participation. Some classes meet for one day on a
  specialized topic, others delve deeper over several sessions.<br /><br /><img
