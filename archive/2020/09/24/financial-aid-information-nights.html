  />Kankakee Community College is hosting financial aid information nights and workshops to assist college-bound
  students and their parents in understanding the <a

    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"
  >financial aid process</a>.<br /><br />The first workshops help students and their parents better understand how to
  pay for the costs of going to college. They will share how to fill out the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student
  Aid), the form used at all two- and four-year colleges and universities to determine eligibility for federal and state
  grants, work-study programs, subsidized &amp; unsubsidized student loans and some scholarships. Staff will also
  explain and clarify the types of aid which is available.<br /><br />An <strong>in-person session will be Thursday,
    Oct. 1, 2020</strong>, from 6-8 p.m. in Room M120 on KCC’s Riverfront Campus, 100 College Drive in Kankakee. It will
  be “hands-on,” for those who want  to complete the FAFSA as the steps are presented.<br /><br />The <strong>live
    webinar session will be Tuesday, Oct. 20, 2020</strong> from 6-8 p.m.<br /><br />Three additional FAFSA workshops
  with scholarship information will be offered, once in person and twice as a live webinar.<br /><br />The
  <strong>in-person session will be Wednesday, Nov. 4, 2020</strong> from 6-8 p.m. in Room M120 on KCC’s Riverfront
  Campus. Those who attend can work on their own FAFSA and scholarship application during the time.<br /><br />The FAFSA
  &amp; Scholarship Workshop <strong>live webinar will be Thursday, Nov. 19, 2020</strong> from 6-8 p.m. <strong>and
    Wednesday, Dec. 9, 2020</strong> from 6-8 p.m.<br /><br />All sessions are provided as a public service and are open
  to students and parents regardless of the college they plan to attend.<br /><br />The FAFSA becomes available Oct.
  1. <br /><br />“We recommend that everyone complete the FAFSA as soon as possible because most funds are distributed
  on a first-come, first-served basis,” said Kendra Souligne, KCC coordinator of financial aid. “Even if your plans
  aren’t finalized, your financial aid package starts with submitting a FAFSA.”<br /><br />To register for any of the
