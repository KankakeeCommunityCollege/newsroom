<p><img src="https://cdn.kcc.edu/newsroom/2020/give-day-change-lives-screenshot.jpg" alt="" class="float-image-left" width="325" height="184" />The recent Kankakee Community College Foundation Give Day proved we are #strongtogether!  <br /><br />On Thursday, Aug. 27, the KCC Foundation held a first-ever Give Day virtual event asking alumni, faculty, staff and the community to support three KCC initiatives, a Technology Fund; an Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Center Fund; and an Emergency Assistance Fund.<br /><br />The Technology Fund helps current KCC students navigate the impact of remote learning. The Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Center Fund fosters community-building, and provides resources and a safe, inclusive and affirming space for the entire campus community. The Emergency Assistance Fund supports KCC students experiencing an extreme financial hardship that threatens to halt their education. <br /><br />“We want to thank our generous donors who supported Give Day!” said Kelly Myers, executive director of the KCC Foundation. “Together, we raised $39,565. This day of giving provided essential support that will increase the success of our students. Together we really are strong!” <br /><br />More information, updates and opportunities to support KCC students, are online at <a href="https://foundation.kcc.edu">foundation.kcc.edu</a>/.</p>
