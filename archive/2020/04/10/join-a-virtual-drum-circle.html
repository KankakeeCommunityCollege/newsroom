<p>“If you don’t have a drum at home, you can use your desktop, a pan or even a small bottle with coins as a rattle!” said Dawn Wrobel, the course leader.  She will lead participants through several rounds of drumming/percussion. In addition to offering this drum-related course, Wrobel is a part-time teacher for KCC, an experienced crafter and pet enthusiast.</p>
