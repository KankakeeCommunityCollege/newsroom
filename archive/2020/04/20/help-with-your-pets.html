<p>“Meditate with Your Pet,” is a free, healing meditation time to have your pet help you quiet your mind. It meets online from 7:30-8:30 p.m. Wednesday May 13. <br />“This pet-centered meditation technique is an effective way to mindfully connect with both your pet and yourself,” said the presenter, Dawn Wrobel. “Pets can sense stress during these uncertain times, too.
