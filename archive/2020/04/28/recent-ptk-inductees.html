<p>In most years, KCC holds induction ceremonies for new Phi Theta Kappa members each fall and spring semester. This
  spring’s event was planned for April 24, but was canceled due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.</p>
<p>Phi Theta Kappa has recognized academic achievement at associate degree-granting colleges since 1918. It also is the
  largest honor society in American higher education, with more than 3.5 million members and 1,283 chapters in 10
  nations.</p>
<p>The society offers opportunities for scholarships, intellectual enrichment, and personal development through programs
  based on the society’s hallmarks of scholarship, leadership, service, and fellowship. To be eligible for membership,
  students must have a 3.5 grade point average or better on a 4.0 scale.</p>
