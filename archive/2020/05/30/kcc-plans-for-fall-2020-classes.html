<p>The college’s plan for scheduling mainly falls into three categories, said Sheri Cagle, KCC’s associate dean for Health Careers.</p>

<p>For the most part, lecture classes will be online, with some having set time schedules and real-time communication, while others will have a more traditional online format where students set their own schedules.</p>

<p>“The college also has a large number of classes which rely upon hands-on components,” Cagle said. “Those will have online lectures and in-person elements which use social distancing, proper cleaning and disinfecting.”</p>

<p>All plans are based on current information related to the COVID-19 pandemic, Cagle noted. If the state of Illinois makes changes that affect the college, it will be shared as soon as possible.<br /><img src="https://cdn.kcc.edu/newsroom/2020/alex-navarro-dsc-7229-sm.jpg" alt="" class="float-image-left" width="334" height="342" />The class schedule at www.kcc.edu/schedule shows the online/virtual requirement as well as if there are in-person meeting times.  </p>

<p>“As educators, we have never planned a schedule this way, and we understand it is a different model for students, too,” Dr. Francesca Catalano, KCC’s associate dean for Math, Science and Engineering said. </p>

<p>KCC will send registered students a separate email for every class with details on the course. The emails will include the meeting schedule and how each part of the course will be delivered—online, online at scheduled times, in-person, or a combination. As needed, required times and further information will be included.</p>

<p>“We are committed to keeping students on track to completing their educational goals,” Catalano said. “Through offering courses in different formats, we can still accommodate learning outcomes that are needed. Right next to student safety, we place the highest level of importance on quality of instruction, and we are making sure that it will remain high.”</p>

<p>Courses which have an in-person component will use social distancing, maximum occupancies, cleaning and other guidelines to assure that students stay safe. KCC also is continuing all of its services to students, such as free tutoring, advisement, and career services. Most services are offered online.</p>

<p>KCC is accepting enrollments for Fall 2020, which begins Aug. 17. </p>

<p>The college is offering online advisement appointments for current students, available at <a href="https://kccadvising.setmore.com/https://kccadvising.setmore.com/" target="_blank">https://kccadvising.setmore.com/</a>. Returning students can also register online or contact an advisor for information on registering.</p>

<p>New students are asked to complete an application at <a href="https://apply.kcc.edu">https://apply.kcc.edu</a> or request information through <a href="https://register.kcc.edu">https://register.kcc.edu</a>. New students take part in an online Cav Day orientation experience before registering.</p>
