<p>Those who are laid off or out of work—whether or not due to the COVID-19 pandemic—are invited to explore different career avenues with the help of <a href="https://wioa.kcc.edu/">Kankakee Workforce Services</a>, a local American Job Center. </p>

<p>Workforce services include helping job seekers with free resources to explore career options, linking job seekers with certificate or short-term training if necessary, reviewing resumes, giving search tips, helping with the application process, providing practice on interviewing skills, and more.</p>

<p>Through the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) Dislocated Worker program, Workforce Services provides individuals who have been laid off with scholarships for training in in-demand occupations. </p>

<p>WIOA participant scholarships are up to $10,000 in tuition, plus $2,500 per year for books and training-related fees and supplies. Reimbursement for fuel to travel to classes is also available. Individuals who receive unemployment insurance do not lose benefits when they enroll in a certificate or degree through WIOA.</p>

<p>Other job search services are available including free virtual workshops in resume writing and interviewing for success for those who choose not to enroll in further training.</p>

<p>For assistance finding a career direction, Workforce Services offers free online questionnaires to match the person’s skills with career options. A variety of <a href="https://www.illinoisworknet.com/explore/Pages/SkillandInterestSurveys.aspx" target="_blank">Skills and Interest Surveys</a> are on the Illinois WorkNet website for those who create an account.</p>

<p>Kankakee Workforce Services is administered by Kankakee Community College, and all programs/services are free under the WIOA grant. Funding is provided by the Grundy Livingston Kankakee Workforce Board. </p>
