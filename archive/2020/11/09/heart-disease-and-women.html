<p>Health care providers are invited to spend the morning of Thursday, Nov. 19 to learn about caring for women with heart disease.</p>

It will prepare you to identify risk factors, clinical presentation and management of heart disease in women. In addition, you will learn to confidently care for women with takosubo cardiomyopathy and peripartium cardiomyopathy.”</p>

<p>Other topics will include recognizing specific symptoms and outlining a plan of care. </p>
