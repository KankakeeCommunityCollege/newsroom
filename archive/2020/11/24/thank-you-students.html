<p>KCC Students,</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/michael-boyd-dsc-3388.jpg" alt="" class="float-image-right" width="250" height="250" />It’s the time of year to express gratitude and say thank you to all the people who are making an impact on our lives. So, on behalf of all of us here at KCC, I want to thank you for sticking with us through what may be the most difficult academic year of our college’s history. No one knows better than you do how challenging it is to be a student during a global pandemic, but you’ve shown true resilience and incredible determination. </p>

<p>Thank you for trusting KCC to be your college home. Thank you for being flexible and understanding as we all learned how to be successful in online and hybrid classes. Thank you for maintaining your social distance while on campus. Thank you for washing your hands, using hand sanitizer, and keeping your masks secure over your mouth and nose all the time. Most of all, thank you for being a proud KCC Cavalier and registering early for your spring classes. </p>

<p>As we learn more and more about COVID-19 treatments and vaccines, we know that there is light at the end of this tunnel. We are going to make it through this pandemic. When we do, our classrooms will be filled with students, our athletic facilities will host competitions, our College Center will be teeming with student life, and our courtyard will once again be filled with the proud families of our graduating class. It’s going to happen, and when we are on the other side of this national disaster, we’ll be able to look at each other with a sense of shared pride that we did this together, supporting one another through the whole thing.</p>

<p>I’m thankful for each and every one of KCC’s students. In this season, I hope you are just as thankful. </p>
