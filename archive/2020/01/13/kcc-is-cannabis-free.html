<p>Despite changes in state laws, possessing, using or selling cannabis in any form at KCC is banned.</p>

<p>Because KCC receives funding from the federal government, we abide by the rules in the Drug Free Schools Act and the Drug Free Workplace Act. That means possessing or using cannabis at any KCC location is not allowed.</p>
