<p>The renovation of the Miner Memorial Library into the KCC Student Success Center is underway.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.kcc.edu/newsroom/2020/library-north-looking-east.jpg" alt="" class="float-image-left" width="355" height="252" /> During construction, all library services are operating out of KCC Room D212, on the second floor of the Workforce Development Center, next to the Foundation Office.  </p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.kcc.edu/newsroom/2020/tutoring-looking-east.jpg" alt="" class="float-image-right" width="395" height="251" /> Quiet study for students is available in Room L369, a classroom next to the division offices on the third floor. Room L369 is reserved for the entire renovation project as a space where students can read and study without interruption or noise.  </p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.kcc.edu/newsroom/2020/library-south-looking-east.jpg" alt="" class="float-image-left" width="377" height="248" /> Other spaces for group and individual study are listed on the<a href="https://kcc.libanswers.com/library/faq/270883" target="_blank">Library FAQ page</a>.</p>

<p> There also are a couple of computers in Room D212 (the temporary library) for research assistance. Students who just need a computer to work on homework or other tasks can use the <a href="https://kcc.libanswers.com/library/faq/270159" target="_blank">guide to other computer/printer locations</a>. Generally speaking, students may use any computer lab where a class is not currently being held - check the sign on the door for that room’s schedule.</p>

<p>The new Student Success Center is scheduled to open before the Fall 2020 semester begins. Some renderings of how it will look are included as part of this article.</p>

<p><strong>Hours</strong></p>

<p>Beginning Jan. 13, the library hours in Room D212 will be 7 a.m. - 6 p.m. Monday - Thursday, and 7 a.m. - 4 pm Fridays. </p>
