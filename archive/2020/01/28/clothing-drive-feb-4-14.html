<p>Start your spring cleaning early and donate clothing to help homeless animals!</p>

<p>Perfect Paws earns money for every pound of clothing they donate to Savers, a resale shop.</p>

<p>Drop off clothes directly at Perfect Paws Animal Rescue, located at 4216 E. 5000N Rd in Bourbonnais OR bring them to KCC. A drop off bin will be at the Welcome Center entranceâ€“the entrance closest to the student parking lot.</p>
