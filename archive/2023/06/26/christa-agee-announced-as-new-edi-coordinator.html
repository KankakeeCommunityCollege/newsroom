<p><img src="/uploads/2023/christa-agee-400x260.jpg" alt="" class="float-image-right" width="400" height="260" />The new coordinator of equity, diversity, and inclusion at Kankakee Community College is Christa Agee.</p>

<p>“Christa is passionate about education and student advocacy,” said Kendra Souligne, KCC director of financial aid and student engagement. “She will strive for not only the representation of all students, but to also foster an environment in which students feel welcome to be actively involved.”</p>

<p>Agee is primarily responsible for KCC’s Center for Equity, Diversity &amp; Inclusion, along with internal and external cultural programming and messaging from the EDI Center, Souligne said. Agee also will develop educational programs and a minority student success program. Her role includes assisting underrepresented students to find resources as they start college as well as support to stay enrolled.</p>

<p>“As the new EDI coordinator, I hope to continue the great work that has already been done to complete this great circle of inclusion and representation for all of the students of KCC,” Agee said.</p>

<p>Previously, Agee worked for the Early Head Start Program at Governors State University and as a special education teacher for over 10 years in Sauk Village and Milford. Agee has a bachelor’s degree in psychology from Illinois State University and a master’s degree in multicategorical special education from Governors State University.</p>
