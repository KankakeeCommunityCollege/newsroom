<p>KCC is hosting a Girls Basketball Camp July 25, 26 and 27.</p>

<p>This camp features key fundamental emphasis and individual skill development. There will be an emphasis on shooting and dribbling. Players will also take part in light conditioning drills and discuss stretching and nutrition. Groups will be made up by age, size and skill to allow for more individual instruction. </p>
