<p>The elevator inside of the KCC Miner Memorial Library is out of order.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the broken part cannot be replaced quickly. So, there is no timeline for when it will be back in service.Â </p>

<p>We apologize for the inconvenience.</p>

<p>If more updates or a timeframe becomes available, that information will be added here.</p>
