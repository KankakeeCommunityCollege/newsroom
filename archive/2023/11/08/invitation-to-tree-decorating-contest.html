  <li>The Hort Club is encouraging participants to embrace the theme of "nature-friendliness" in their tree decorations.</li>
  <li>The judging date will be Thursday, Nov. 30.</li>
  <li>The department or club that best embodies the "nature-friendly" theme in their tree decoration will be awarded a prize.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, gather your team, brainstorm ideas, and get ready to turn your Christmas tree into a masterpiece that highlights the beauty of nature.</p>
