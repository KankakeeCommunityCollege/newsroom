<p><img src="/uploads/2022/dylan-dodd-250x318.jpg" alt="" class="float-image-right ms-1" width="250" height="318" />Dylan Dodd '18, will be on the roster as the Atlanta Braves open the 2023 baseball season.</p>

<p>A left-hander originally from Bismark, which is near Danville, Dodd is expected to make his MLB debut on Tuesday, April 4 when the Braves play the St. Louis Cardinals.</p>

<p>As a Cavalier, Dodd played all around the field – infield, outfield and pitcher – during the <a href="https://region4sports.com/sports/bsb/2016-17/players/dylandoddxa8u" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2017</a> and <a href="https://region4sports.com/sports/bsb/2017-18/players/dylandoddqef4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018</a> seasons. He was a freshman when KCC won the NJCAA Div. II national championship in 2017.</p>

<p>After KCC, Dodd transferred to Southeast Missouri State University, and was drafted by the Braves in 2021.</p>
