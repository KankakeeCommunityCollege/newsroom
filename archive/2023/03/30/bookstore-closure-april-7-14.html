<p><img src="/uploads/2022/hammes-bookstore250x286.jpg" alt="" class="float-image-right" width="250" height="286" />Good news from the KCC Hammes Bookstore: It is time for the books and merchandise to move into the new location across from the Miner Memorial Library on KCC's Riverfront Campus.</p>

<p>To make a smooth transition, the <a href="https://books.kcc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bookstore</a> will be closed Friday, April 7 to Friday, April 14. We apologize for the inconvenience, but know that the new site will be worth the wait.</p>

<p>The bookstore will re-open at 8:30 a.m. on Monday, April 17 â€“ and you'll find a more modern and comfortable shopping environment in the new location.</p>
