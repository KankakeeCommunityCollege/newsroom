<p>Some good news: the west elevator, which was undergoing repairs, is now fully operational again. Students and staff can use it again.</p>

<p>Before being re-opened for public use, the elevator successfully passed an operation inspection conducted by the state fire marshall.</p>

<p>We appreciate everyone's patience and understanding while the elevator was being updated.</p>
