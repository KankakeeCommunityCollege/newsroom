<p>KCC’s Placement Testing Center in Room D218 has current hours posted on the placement testing webpage, <a href="https://www.kcc.edu/admissions/testing/#location-and-hours">Location &amp; Hours tab</a>.</p>

<p>For students who need to test at a specific time, it’s recommended that you make an appointment by emailing <a href="mailto:testingcenter@kcc.edu">testingcenter@kcc.edu</a>. It is also helpful for students to plan for enough time to complete exams before the Testing Center closes. To complete a make-up exam for a course, allow for the time the professor indicates. For placement testing, allow one hour for ACCUPLACER and one hour for ALEKS.</p>

<p>New signage will also be on the Placement Testing Center door (Room D218) with a link to the online calendar and QR code to scan for <a href="https://www.kcc.edu/admissions/testing/#location-and-hours">current hours</a>.</p>
