<p>The One Workforce grant at Kankakee Community College is accepting new students to complete programs for free from now through December 2024.</p>

<p>Because the grant funding expires in December 2024, students can still take advantage of the grant for Spring 2024, Summer 2024 and Fall 2024 enrollment, explained Mark Anderson, the program director.</p>

<p>“Diesel Technology students can still get their program covered 100% because the entire certificate program can be completed before December 2024,” Anderson said. “Students can receive grant funds to complete a manufacturing-related advanced certificate of 30+ credit hours or less in that timeframe.”</p>

<p>To date, more than 160 KCC students have taken advantage of the One Workforce grant. It covers tuition, textbooks, fees, hand tools, materials, and personal protective equipment for students enrolled in programs which can lead to employment in a field related to manufacturing.</p>

<p>The students are enrolled in KCC manufacturing-based certificates and associate degrees such as: welding, machine tool, industrial maintenance, electrical technology, and manufacturing technology.</p>

<p>“I think people who are willing to work in the manufacturing industries should know about One Workforce because it helps and guides you through everything you need to know about the manufacturing industries,” said Ogechukwu Onwuegbuchu, who is completing his third semester at KCC.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2022/calumet-industrial-caic-logo350x230.png" alt="" class="float-image-right" />The grant’s formal title is “U.S. Department of Labor H-1B One Workforce Grant Program.” It is offered in affiliation with the Calumet Area Industrial Commission.</p>

<p>“When I first interview prospective grant students, they are shocked that all the expenses for their college degree/certificate are paid for by the CAIC – One Workforce Grant for Advanced Manufacturing,” Anderson said. ‘“OK, what’s the catch?’ is the typical student response after I list what the grant will pay for. I continue to tell them that there is no catch, but it does take the student a while … to realize that the opportunity is real and is available immediately.</p>

<p>The One Workforce Grant had its first group at KCC enrolled in August 2021.</p>

<p>Awards though December 2023 have not been calculated yet, the most recent information is from August 2021 to December 2022. It shows the One Workforce Grant in the CAIC region awarded more than $181,000 in direct payments for KCC students’ tuition, textbooks, fees, tools, materials, and personal protective equipment including Red Wing work boots.</p>

<p>The Calumet Area Industrial Commission grant region ranges from Kankakee to Joliet to Des Plaines and all of Chicago; plus Lake, LaPorte and Porter counties in Indiana.</p>
