<p>World Cancer Day is Saturday, Feb. 4, 2023.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2022/world-cancer-basketball-200x200.jpg" alt="" class="float-image-right" width="200" height="200" />KCC women's basketball head coach Meister and the Cavaliers will host a World Cancer Game on Saturday, Feb. 4 at 1 p.m. vs. Sauk Valley Community College. The KCC men will have a game at 3 p.m., also against Sauk Valley.</p>

<p>Meister and her family recently lost a brother-in-law and wonderful uncle, Jeff Hanson, to cancer. "Jeff was a true sports fan who loved and supported all sports, both men and women’s," Meister said.</p>

<p>When merchandise is purchased from <a href="https://fastlanewraps-f2bf48f0-1356-4228-ae03-6a72e2cb13e6.printavo.com/merch/kcc-world-cancer-day-fundraiser?fbclid=IwAR2yxR03MCVTZE3cVvbnKoUv8DklezdE4_kZI7ky2klS2JyQGaAhepeqIRo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the link</a>, $5 of every item sold will benefit the Anthony Rizzo Family Foundation. The foundation raises money for cancer research and provides support to children and their families battling the disease. The <a href="https://fastlanewraps-f2bf48f0-1356-4228-ae03-6a72e2cb13e6.printavo.com/merch/kcc-world-cancer-day-fundraiser?fbclid=IwAR2yxR03MCVTZE3cVvbnKoUv8DklezdE4_kZI7ky2klS2JyQGaAhepeqIRo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">merchandise store</a> closes on Thursday, Jan. 19 at 11:59 p.m.</p>

<p>"This foundation has been a big part of Jeff’s journey before and after his diagnosis," Meister said. "We are all affected in some way by this terrible disease and it’s our turn to give back.</p>

<p>"Our goal is to raise $500. We are up for the challenge and would love the community’s support for this wonderful cause."</p>

<p>Anyone who purchases gear from the <a href="https://fastlanewraps-f2bf48f0-1356-4228-ae03-6a72e2cb13e6.printavo.com/merch/kcc-world-cancer-day-fundraiser?fbclid=IwAR2yxR03MCVTZE3cVvbnKoUv8DklezdE4_kZI7ky2klS2JyQGaAhepeqIRo">fundraiser website</a> will receive free admission to the games on Feb. 4.
