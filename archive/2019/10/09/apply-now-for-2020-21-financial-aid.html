<p><img src="/uploads/piggy-bank---copy-1.jpg" alt="" class="float-image-left" width="248" height="248" />The 2020-21 <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa">FAFSA</a> (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) is available to apply for Fall 2020 to Summer 2021 financial aid.</p>

<p>“It is important to complete a FAFSA as soon as possible after it becomes available Oct. 1,” said Michelle Hasik, KCC director of financial aid. “It does not matter if you have chosen a college or university, or even if the student will attend college. Completing the FAFSA early provides a safety net so when plans are finalized it is not too late to receive grants, student loans and scholarships.”</p>

<p>KCC also offers a series of <a href="http://www.kcc.edu/future/paying/fedstateaid/Pages/fafsa-scholarship-workshops.aspx">Free FAFSA workshops</a> to help fill out the forms.</p>
