  />The <em>2020-2021 <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa">FAFSA</a> application is available for students to
    begin applying for their financial aid for the fall 2020-summer 2021 school year</em>.</p>

<p>“It is important to complete a FAFSA as soon as possible after it becomes available Oct. 1,” said Michelle Hasik, KCC
  director of financial aid. “It does not matter if you have chosen a college or university, or even if the student will
  attend college. Completing the FAFSA early provides a safety net so when plans are finalized it is not too late to
  receive grants, student loans and scholarships.”</p>
