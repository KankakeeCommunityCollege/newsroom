  />For his commitment to adult learners, Gregg Beglau has received the <a href="https://www.iacea.net/">Illinois Adult
    and Continuing Educators Association</a> Support Staff of the Year Award.</p>

<p>“Gregg is a true advocate for our Adult Education and ESL students,” said Maggie Wolf, director of <a
    href="https://adulted.kcc.edu/"
  >adult education</a> at KCC. “From the point of first contact in our program to the moment they matriculate to the
  college, and often beyond, Gregg is there with a smile to help with whatever question is asked.”</p>

<p>Beglau coordinates high school equivalency and English as a Second Language courses at Kankakee Community College.
  The award was announced on Thursday, March 7, 2019 at the association’s conference in Springfield. Due to a family
  commitment and his service in the U.S. Naval Reserves, he was presented with the plaque on March 25 at KCC.</p>

<p>Among other criteria, it recognizes a person who accepts the cultural and ethnic uniqueness of learners; provides a
  non-threatening, supportive atmosphere; communicates effectively; fosters and maintains community resources; and is
  flexible and innovative.</p>

<p>“When I hit a roadblock with my financial aid, he walked me down to financial aid and stayed with me to make sure
  that I understood everything that they told me,” said Miguel Lara, a current student. “When times got hard, he
  wouldn't let me give up. He has been my biggest influence, he has taught me not to give up and to help others.”</p>

<p>Beglau worked part-time at KCC for six years, then was hired as the coordinator of student support and transition for
  the Adult Education Department in September 2016.</p>

<p>“Gregg is a joy to work with and an asset to our division,” said Liz East, administrative assistant for the Adult and
  Community Education Department. “He has such a caring personality that students can talk with him and he will try to
  assist their needs. His humorous personality helps to make the work environment enjoyable.”</p>

<p>It is the third year in a row that a KCC employee has earned a statewide award from the Illinois Adult and Continuing
  Educators Association. In 2017, Wolf was named the organization’s Administrator of the Year; and in 2018, Donna Mann
  was named the Arthur J. Stejskal Teacher of the Year.</p>
