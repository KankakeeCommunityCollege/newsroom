<p>“Shawn was an outstanding Education student,” said Jessica Reardanz-Friedericks, KCC education professor. “His work
  ethic was amazing. Never one to settle for anything but the best, Shawn submitted thoughtful and detailed assessments
  on a consistent basis. I could always count on Shawn to do his best. I still use a video he created as an example in
  my Exceptional Learner course, because it is that good. </p>

<p>“I'm just so excited for him that his efforts were recognized!”</p>

<p>After completing an Associate of Arts in Teaching, Special Education, from KCC, Mann transferred to Illinois State
  University.</p>

<p>The award is named after Bob Haisman, and recognizes a “new teacher” and IEA member who has shown outstanding
  accomplishments in involvement in his/her local, state, and/or national association, achievements in his/her
  profession, in promoting public education, and enhancement of the image of “new teacher” in the Association, the
  school or the community.</p>
