  />Medical Laboratory Professionals Week will be observed nationally April 21-27, 2019. </p>

<p>This week recognizes the contributions of the laboratory professionals whose work in medical laboratories help give
  our nation the best possible health care. </p>

<p>"These medical laboratory personnel play an increasingly vital role in the diagnosis and prevention of disease; and
  often their dedicated efforts are unseen as they work behind the scenes," said Glenda Forneris, director of KCC's
  Medical Laboratory Technology program.</p>

<p>"Every day physicians and other healthcare workers depend on laboratory professionals to perform tests on blood and
  other body fluids, interpret the results, and help provide a complete picture of a patient's health," Forneris said. 
</p>

<p>Using modern biomedical equipment and complicated analysis, these professionals can detect the presence of cancer,
  identify infectious viruses and bacteria, and measure glucose, cholesterol, or drug levels in blood.</p>

<p>"Without this precise and valuable information, medicine would simply become guesswork," Forneris said.</p>

<p>KCC Medical Laboratory Technology students will have a display table Tuesday, April 16 from 10 a.m. - noon to share
  information about the profession and the program. There will also be an opportunity to try your hand at performing a
  few "lab tests."</p>
