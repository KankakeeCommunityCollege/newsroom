  />About 450 people will graduate at the 50th annual Kankakee Community College commencement ceremony at 10 a.m.
  Saturday, May 11 in the George H. Ryan Gymnasium in the college's Activities Building. </p>

<p>A number of students, faculty and alumni accomplishments will be recognized. The speaker will be the college’s
  president, Dr. John Avendano. He is a community college graduate and has more than 30 years of experience working for
  community colleges in Illinois. </p>

<p>“Over the years, as both a student and later as an employee of the community college system in Illinois, I came to
  fully realize the impact our two-year institutions have on the lives of those we serve,” Avendano said. “As a result,
  I have dedicated my entire career to the mission and purpose of community colleges.” </p>
