  />The 2019 Kankakee Community College Student Art Exhibition is on display until May 1 in the KCC art gallery on the
  lower level of the Harold and Jean Miner Memorial Library.</p>

<p>“The KCC Student show is the exciting culmination of a year of hard work for our artists,” said KCC Professor Chelise
  Slowik.  “We are so proud of the hard work and growth they’ve made, and the quality of the artwork produces a stunning
  exhibition.”</p>

<p>There are 88 artworks by 25 students on display. The artwork represents a wide variety of styles and mediums,
  including drawing, painting, ceramic and sculpture.</p>

<p>“KCC is the perfect place, not only for students who are embarking on their career in the arts, but for those who
  want to explore different media in order to enrich their lives with creativity,” Slowik said.</p>

<p>Gallery hours are 7 a.m. - 8 p.m. Monday through Thursday and 7 a.m. - 4 p.m. Fridays.  Closed on the weekends.</p>

<p>The public is invited to a reception for the artists from 5:30-7 p.m. Wednesday, May 1. Refreshments will be served.
