<p>Yesterday (June 19), KCC called a licensed exterminator to investigate a report of bed bugs in the Miner Memorial
  Library. The bugs were found in one couch in the library.</p>

<p>Other areas of the library, a nearby hallway, and the Child Development Center were also inspected. No more bugs were
  found.</p>

<p>The affected area was treated—and a number of other locations were treated as a precaution. The couch and several
  other pieces of nearby furniture have been bagged and removed.</p>

<p>The exterminator will return to check the area in about two weeks.</p>

<p>The library will re-open on Monday, June 24.</p>

<p>Anyone with questions regarding KCC’s response efforts can contact <a href="byeoman@kcc.edu">Brian Yeoman</a>,
  assistant director of Physical Plant Operations; or <a href="mailto:rkenney@kcc.edu">Rob Kenney</a>, coordinator of
  Facility Construction &amp; Building Maintenance.</p>
