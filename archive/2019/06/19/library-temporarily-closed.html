<p>Earlier today, KCC closed the Miner Memorial Library after a student reported seeing what he suspected were bed bugs.</p>

<p>KCC takes this issue seriously. The collegeâ€™s Physical Plant Department immediately contacted a licensed exterminator service.</p>

<p>Following confirmation by the pest control specialist, measures to remove the bugs have begun. As they continue, the library will remain closed until further notice.</p>

<div><p>Other areas of the college were also inspected. The bugs have not traveled beyond the area where they were found. The exterminator will return after an appropriate amount of time to monitor the situation and be sure that the bugs are no longer present.</p><p>If you have any questions regarding our response efforts, please feel free to contact Brian Yeoman, assistant director of Physical Plant Operations, <a href="mailto:byeoman@kcc.edu">byeoman@kcc.edu</a>; or Rob Kenney, coordinator of Facility Construction &amp; Building Maintenance, <a href="mailto:rkenney@kcc.edu">rkenney@kcc.edu</a>.</p><p>Detailed information on bed bugs and appropriate control measures can be obtained on the <a href="http://www.dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/environmental-health-protection/structural-pest-control/bed-bugs#resources">Illinois Department of Public Health</a> and <a href="https://www.epa.gov/managing-pests-schools/bed-bugs-and-schools#steps">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a> web sites.</p></div>
