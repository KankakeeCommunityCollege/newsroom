<p>KCC is part of the annual <a href="https://www.kankakeecountymuseum.com/event---gallery-of-trees.html">Gallery of
    Trees exhibit</a> at the Kankakee County Historical Society.</p>

<p>From Dec. 1-30, the tree will be on display with others from community organizations. The public is invited to the
  event and can vote for a favorite tree (hopefully it’ll be KCC’s). </p>

  />With a theme of “It’s a Magical Christmas,” the trees have Disney themes. KCC’s tree has a  “Cars” theme. It
  includes ornaments with graphics and sayings from—and inspired by—the movie such as</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tow-Tally Awesome</li>
  <li>Race to a Great Future</li>
  <li>Keep it Wheel</li>
  <li>Life is a Journey. Enjoy the Trip.</li>
  <li>Git’r Done</li>
  <li>Paving Your Future</li>
  <li>It’s Drive Time</li>
</ul>

<p>“My pit-crew's goal was to pay homage to the <em>Cars</em> movie and road theme, while placing a KCC spin on the
  ornamentation," said Alison Nakaerts, who headed up the tree crew. "Just like KCC, there are many roads and directions
  we all travel, and everyone should always look for the checkered flag! I hope we pull of a Cavaliers victory in the
  tree contest.”</p>

<p>The museum is at 801 S 8th Ave, Kankakee. More details and museum hours are on the <a
