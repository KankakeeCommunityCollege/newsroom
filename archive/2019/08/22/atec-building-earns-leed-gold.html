<p>The sustainable design of Kankakee Community College’s newest building has earned the college a $150,000 grant, and
  status as a LEED Gold-certified building.</p>

  />The Advanced Technology Education Center, known as ATEC, opened in January 2019 on the college’s Riverfront Campus
  in Kankakee. It houses KCC’s award-winning <a

  >Electrical Engineering Technology program</a>. </p>

<p>LEED certification is based on scores given to the building for its environmentally-friendly attributes. The process
  looks at a facility comprehensively, considering site issues, water efficiency, energy efficiency, materials use and
  indoor environmental quality.</p>

<p>“We are very proud to showcase so many environmentally friendly features in one place,” said Rob Kenney, KCC’s
  coordinator of facility construction. “The building runs in a very cost-effective manner, while still producing fewer
  greenhouse gases than a similarly-sized non-LEED building would. Through motion sensors and other efficiencies, the
  savings occur without affecting people’s comfort. It is a great demonstration of the college’s commitment to
  responsible architecture.”</p>

<p>Within the two-story, 21,000 square foot ATEC building, there are classrooms, labs, offices, and support spaces to
  provide hands-on technical training in fields such as wind generation, solar thermal, solar photo-voltaic systems, and
  electrical (National Electric Code) instruction. The facility also houses continuing training for technicians and
  electricians who are already in the profession.</p>

<p>The building includes numerous features which were planned out to ensure energy efficiency. Among the ways it treads
  lightly on the environment, the center has a white synthetic roof, geothermal wells for heating and cooling, automated
  temperature controls, abundant natural light, and light sensors. A portion of the center’s electricity is channeled
  through KCC’s wind turbine and photovoltaic array. It also incorporates low-flow fixtures and high-efficiency
  lighting. </p>

<p>KCC will receive $150,000 in grant funds from the Illinois Clean Energy Community Foundation  which recognizes the
  building’s sustainable and energy efficient design and construction. The money was allocated in 2015. It is from an
  independent foundation endowed by Commonwealth Edison. Their mission, as stated at illinoiscleanenergy.org, is to
  “improve energy efficiency, advance the development and use of renewable energy resources, and protect natural areas
  and wildlife habitat in communities all across Illinois.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bldd.com/">BLDD Architects</a> of Chicago was the architect, and <a

  />The ATEC Building opened for classes for the first time in January 2019.<br />In 2007, KCC signed the American
  College and University President’s Climate Commitment. The college also participates at the gold level in the Illinois
  Sustainable University Compact. As part of these commitments, all new college construction will be built to the U.S.
  Green Building Council’s LEED Silver standard or higher.</p>

<p>In 2014, KCC’s North Extension Center at 450 N. Kinzie Ave. in Bradley became Kankakee County’s first building to
  earn LEED Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council.</p>
