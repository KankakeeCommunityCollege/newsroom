<p>Reviewers from the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools conducted a site visit at KCC’s Harold and Jean Miner South Extension Center in Watseka on Dec. 13.</p>

<p>“The Higher Learning Commission visited our site since we are now offering an entire associate degree at the SEC through the new Fast Path program,” said Dr. Michael Boyd, KCC vice president for instructional and student success.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/south-extension-centerdsc-1436.jpg" alt="" class="float-image-left" />The Fast Path program offers admitted students a schedule with two classes at a time, offered two days a week for two years. Upon completion, the students earn an Associate in Arts degree.</p>

<p>If the HLC report affirms that KCC delivers appropriate services, then the South Extension Center will continue to offer full associate degree programs for students.</p>

<p>The Higher Learning Commission is one of six accrediting agencies in the United States which provides institutional accreditation on a regional basis. KCC has held Higher Learning Commission accreditation since 1974. The KCC expects to receive a decision from the Higher Learning Commission in the next few weeks.</p>
