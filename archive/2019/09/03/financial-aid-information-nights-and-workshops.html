  />KCC is hosting financial aid information nights and workshops to assist college-bound students and their parents in
  understanding the financial aid process.</p>

<p>All sessions are hands-on and designed to help with filling out the <a href="https://fafsa.gov">FAFSA</a> (Free
  Application for Federal Student Aid), the form used at all two- and four-year colleges and universities to determine
  eligibility for federal and state grants, work-study programs, subsidized &amp; unsubsidized student loans and some
  scholarships. <br />KCC Financial Aid staff will be available to provide assistance in completing the FAFSA.</p>

<p>Sessions after Nov. 1 will also have information on applying for KCC scholarships. See information below for
  locations. The schedule is … </p>

<p>“It is important to complete a FAFSA as soon as possible after it becomes available Oct. 1,” said Michelle Hasik, KCC
  director of financial aid. “It does not matter if you have chosen a college or university, or even if the student will
  attend college. Completing the FAFSA early provides a safety net so when plans are finalized it is not too late to
  receive grants, student loans and scholarships.”</p>
