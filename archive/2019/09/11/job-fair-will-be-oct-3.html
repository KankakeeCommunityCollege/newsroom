<p>“Preparation is a key to success for attending a job fair,” said Kim Schott, coordinator of career services at KCC.
  “One way to get ready is by attending a free workshop being offered before the event.”</p>

<p>The job fair workshops are listed at <a href="http://www.kcc.edu/careerservices">kcc.edu/careerservices</a>. They
  include<a href="https://www.enrole.com/kcc/jsp/course.jsp?categoryId=BF7C25B0&amp;courseId=LECT-9057">“Working a Job
    Fair: How to Improve Your Odds,”</a> on Wednesday, Sept. 25. Other sessions concentrate on resumes, cover letters,
  job search skills and interview skills.<br />More than 50 businesses and industries will be at the Job Fair. Employers
  will conduct pre-screening interviews for full- and part-time positions. Manufacturers will be available to answer
  questions, accept applications/resumes, and to demonstrate their products. </p>
