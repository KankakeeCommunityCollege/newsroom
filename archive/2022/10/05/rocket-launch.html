<p>KCC’s <a href="https://www.kcc.edu/student-resources/clubs/#stem-club">STEM Club</a> took advantage of some great weather on Tuesday, Oct. 4 and had<img src="/uploads/2022/rocket-350x525.JPG" alt="" class="float-image-right" width="350" height="525" /> a rocket launching competition on the north side of the Riverfront Campus.</p>

<p>The rockets were launched using compressed air, so no flammables were used. Students tried to land the rockets within three target areas in the field. Those who landed their rocket inside the targets (or close) got points.</p>

<p>“Overall, we had about 10 club members take part and they had a great time as you can see from the photos!” said Michael Caparula, one of the club’s sponsors.</p>

<p>STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math.<img src="/uploads/2022/rocket-400x267.JPG" alt="" class="float-image-left" width="400" height="267" /></p>
