<p><img src="/uploads/2022/juneteenth-coloring-graphic280x178.jpg" alt="" class="float-image-right" width="280" height="178" />The KCC <a href="https://www.kcc.edu/EDI">Center for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion</a> is holding a Juneteenth coloring contest until June 15.</p>

<p>To participate, kids under age 12 are invited to start by <a href="/uploads/2022/pdf/Juneteenth-ColoringSheet_2022.pdf">downloading a coloring sheet</a>. The sheet includes an image of the Juneteenth flag and the words "Juneteenth Freedom Day." Those unfamiliar with the flag can research the Juneteenth flag to learn about the inspiration for the image, and the flag colors. </p>

<p>The contest ends June 15. There are two ways to return the coloring sheets: in person at the KCC North Extension Center, 450 N. Kinzie Ave. in Bradley; or by taking a photo of the entry and sending it by email to <a href="mailto:wmittons@kcc.edu">wmittons@kcc.edu</a>.</p>

<p>Prizes will be awarded to one participant from each age group: ages 4-6, ages 7-9 &amp; ages 10-12. </p>

<p>Complete details are on the <a href="https://www.kcc.edu/student-resources/edi/">Center for Equity, Diversity &amp; Inclusion page</a>. </p>

<p>Juneteenth is a federal holiday in the U.S., commemorating the emancipation of enslaved African-Americans. It has been celebrated annually in the United States on June 19 since 1865.</p>
