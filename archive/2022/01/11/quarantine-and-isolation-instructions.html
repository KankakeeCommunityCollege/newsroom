<p>Students, employees and visitors who have tested positive for COVID-19, or who have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, are instructed to following the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Center for Disease Control</a> quarantine and isolation instructions.</p>

<p><strong>If you are exposed to someone with COVID-19</strong></p>

<p>The need to quarantine <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depends on your vaccination status</a>. All those who are exposed should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get tested for COVID-19 at least 5 days after your last had close contact with someone with COVID-19.</li>
  <li>Watch for symptoms until 10 days after you last had close contact with someone with COVID-19. Isolate immediately and get tested if you develop symptoms.</li>
  <li>Take precautions for 10 days (wear a mask anytime you are around others, avoid travel, avoid being around people who are at high risk).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If you test positive for COVID-19 or have symptoms</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Isolate for 5 days after onset of symptoms, or 5 days from specimen collection date if no symptoms are present.
    <ul>
      <li>Day 0 is the first day of symptoms or specimen collection date if asymptomatic.</li>
      <li>If you continue to have fever or other symptoms, or have not improved after 5 days of isolation, do not end isolation until you are fever-free for 24 hours and your other symptoms have improved. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Continue to wear a well-fitted mask around others for 5 additional days after release from isolation. If unable to wear a mask when around others, continue to isolate for a total of 10 days. 
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid being around students or staff who are immunocompromised or at high risk for severe disease. </li>
      <li>If masks need to be removed (e.g., for lunch), ensure 6 feet of physical distancing until 10 days after symptom onset or positive test. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
