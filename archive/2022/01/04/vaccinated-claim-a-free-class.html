<p>The free class is offered as a tuition credit at the time of registration. The maximum value is $495. The offer applies only to tuition and basic fees of $165 per credit hour. Additional fees (including lab fees, out-of-district fees and others) are not included. The college will not give any cash back, and it is offered to people who come in-person only.</p>

<p>There is a limit of one free class per student. So, any student who received the free class in Fall 2021 is not eligible anymore.</p>

<p>To redeem, the student must show their own original COVID-19 vaccination card and KCC student ID card at KCC's payment counter. Electronic copies and duplicates are not accepted.</p>

<p>Students who have already registered and paid can follow the procedures above to receive a refund check.</p>

<p>The free class for vaccinated individuals is available only for KCC students enrolled in a credit class or developmental education class for the Spring 2022 semester. Dual credit, non-credit continuing education, adult education, and English as a Second Language classes are excluded. Employees and their dependents are also excluded.</p>

<p>The offer expires May 1, 2022.</p>

<p>The college is paying for the incentive using funds from the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund.</p>

<p>For more information about the free class incentive, email or phone the college's Accounting Office at <a href="mailto:accountingoffice@kcc.edu">accountingoffice@kcc.edu</a> or phone 815-802-8140.</p>

<p>KCC has other sources of funds for Spring 2022 enrollment detailed in another news article titled "<a href="/archive/2021/12/17/spring-2022-funds-for-students/">Spring 2022 funds for students</a>."</p>
