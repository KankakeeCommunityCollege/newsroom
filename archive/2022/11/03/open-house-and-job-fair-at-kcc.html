<p>Program staff will be at the Open House to talk about classes and careers in Early Childhood Education. Tours of classrooms will be available.</p>

<p>There will also be information about the Early Childhood Access Consortium for Equity (ECACE) Scholarship Program. The <a href="http://earlychildhoodscholarship.kcc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ECACE scholarship</a> provides tuition for those who have worked with children ages birth to 5 years old. The scholarship has other qualifications, including being age 18 or older and a U.S. citizen.</p>

<p>“In Fall 2022, 30 KCC students received a total of more than $150,000 in tuition and other assistance for the early childhood program,” said Christina Nojd, director of early childhood success at KCC.</p>

<p>Reservations for the event are not required.</p>

<p>KCC offers <a href="https://kcc.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2022-2023/academic-catalog/programs-of-study-by-area/education/early-childhood-education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">degrees and certificates</a> for people interested in early childhood education.</p>

<p>“With a degree in early childhood education, there are a variety of career pathways that people can explore,” Nojd said. “Opportunities include teaching, assistant teacher/paraprofessional, administration/leadership, and other social programs.”</p>
