<p>More than 400 degrees and certificates will be conferred at the 53rd annual Kankakee Community College commencement ceremony at 10 a.m. Saturday, May 14 in the George H. Ryan Gymnasium in the college's Activities Building.</p>

<p>“It means a lot to me,” said KCC graduate Margaret Corpening of Bradley. “When I first started back in the fall of 2014 I was so determined to achieve my associate’s.” Then Corpening’s father passed away. “I took four years off because I wasn't ready,” she said. “In 2019, I had my second child and realized that I need to set a better future for my kids. I know my dad would be proud of me taking this first leap towards my career. I stumbled and fell, but eventually got back up!”</p>

<p>A number of students, faculty and alumni accomplishments will be recognized.</p>
