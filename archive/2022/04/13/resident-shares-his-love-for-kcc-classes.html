<p>Kankakee resident Tim Wilhelm recently created a <a href="https://youtu.be/nlpZC2asmGs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube video</a> for a KCC class. <img src="/uploads/2022/stem-guitar-person250x222.jpg" alt="" class="float-image-right" width="250" height="222" /></p>

<p>Wilhelm–who taught at KCC full-time from 1997 until 2017–shares his experiences taking classes post-retirement.</p>

<p>"The video has a number of great points about KCC classes, including that people over age 60 don't have to pay tuition – the just  pay fees of $19 per credit, plus any individual course fees," said Ellen Schmidt, who works in KCC's Office of Marketing and Public Relations. "Although this is not an official KCC video, it has a great message that we are proud to share with the community."</p>
