<p>While the treatment of eating disorders requires specialized training, it is important for all health care professionals to understand eating problems and weight concerns.</p>

<p>Kankakee Community College’s Office of Continuing Education and Career Services is offering a one-day training session, “Emotional and Binge Eating, Chronic Dieting, and Body Shame: What Clinicians Need to Know.”</p>

<p>The workshop will be Friday, Sept. 9 from 8:30 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. The cost is $99 per<img src="/uploads/2022/judithmatz-250x250.jpg" alt="Judith Matz" title="Judith Matz" class="float-image-right" width="250" height="250" /> person.</p>

<p>A main topic will be how recovery from eating past fullness and bingeing is more than a matter of self-control, weight loss, or even understanding the emotional triggers.</p>

<p>The presenter is Judith Matz (pictured), a licensed clinical social worker who is a nationally recognized speaker on diet culture, binge eating, emotional eating, body image, and weight stigma.</p>

<p>Additional topics will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The relationship between diet culture, eating problems and weight concerns;</li>
  <li>Five components of the diet-binge cycle;</li>
  <li>Three steps of attuned eating;</li>
  <li>Attitudes toward body size;</li>
  <li>Three strategies to cultivate a healthy body image; and</li>
  <li>The Health At Every Size® paradigm.</li>
</ul>

<p>Upon successful completion, 7 contact hours will be awarded to participants who are nurses, nursing home administrators, dietitians, social workers, and counselors. </p>
