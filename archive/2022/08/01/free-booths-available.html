<p><br /><img src="/uploads/2022/job-fair-250x305.jpg" alt="" class="float-image-right" width="305" height="250" />Kankakee Community College will sponsor a Job Fair from 9 a.m. - noon on Thursday, Sept. 29. </p>

<p>Booths are available, free of charge, for area businesses to participate. The reservation deadline is Sept. 26. Employers can register at <a href="https://www.kcc.edu/jobfair" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.kcc.edu/jobfair</a>.</p>

<p>“Today more than ever, a job fair is the quintessential platform for employers and job seekers to make a face-to-face connection,” said Cesar Avalos, coordinator of workforce opportunities at KCC. “It is the opportunity for our students and our community to secure employment leads, and employers to have a conversation with real people, rather than resumes."</p>

<p>The Job Fair is sponsored by KCC’s Charlton Career Services Center.</p>
