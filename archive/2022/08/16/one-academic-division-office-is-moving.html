<p>Effective Sept. 6, 2022, all of KCC's academic division offices will be in one location: Room W102.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2022/small-graphic-w102-location300x312.jpg" alt="" class="float-image-right" width="300" height="312" />Room W102 is on the first floor, in the Prairie Building (between Health Careers and the Technology and Innovation Center). See graphic or this <a href="https://cdn.kcc.edu/newsroom/pdf/first-floor-5-22-highlightW102.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF of the first floor</a> .</p>

<p>The academic divisions are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Business, Technology &amp; Human Services</li>
  <li>Health Careers</li>
  <li>Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences</li>
</ul>

<p>Two division offices are already in Room W102: Business, Technology &amp; Human Services and Health Careers. Beginning Sept. 6, they will be joined by  Liberal Arts &amp;  Sciences–which is moving from Room L355.</p>

<p>Students seeking information on schedules, college processes, or help communicating with a faculty member should visit Room W102.</p>
