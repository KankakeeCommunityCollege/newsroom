<p>Kankakee Community College is hosting workshops to help college-bound students<img src="/uploads/2022/piggybank-350x328.jpg" alt="KCC Financial Aid Stats - Average Financial Aid award $3,856 and 42.7% of KCC students receive financial aid. from 2018-19 school year report." title="KCC Financial Aid Stats" class="float-image-right" width="350" height="328" /> and their parents understand the financial aid and scholarship process. Staff also will explain and clarify the types of aid which are available.</p>

<p>Each workshop includes how to fill out the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid), the form used at all two- and four-year colleges and universities to determine eligibility for federal and state grants, work-study programs, subsidized and unsubsidized student loans and some scholarships. On Oct. 4, there will also be information about KCC scholarships.</p>

<p>Reservations are not required. The schedule is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Tuesday, Oct. 4</strong>, 6-8 p.m. in KCC Room M120, 100 College Drive in Kankakee.</li>
  <li><strong>Wednesday, Oct. 12</strong>, 4:30-6:30 p.m. at KCC’s Miner South Extension Center, 1488 E. Walnut St. in Watseka.</li>
  <li><strong>Wednesday, Oct. 19</strong>, 6-8 p.m. in KCC Room M120, 100 College Drive in Kankakee.</li>

  <li><strong>Thursday, Dec. 8</strong>, 6-8 p.m. in KCC Room M120, 100 College Drive in Kankakee.</li>
</ul>

<p>All sessions are provided as a public service and are open to students and parents regardless of the college they plan to attend.</p>

<p>The FAFSA becomes available Oct. 1. Students <a href="https://foundation.kcc.edu/scholarships/">can apply for 2023-24 scholarships</a> at KCC from Oct. 1, 2022 - May 1, 2023.</p>

<p>“We recommend that all prospective students complete the FAFSA as soon as possible, even if you are still deciding on a school,” said Megan Ponton, KCC assistant director of financial aid. “Your financial aid package starts with submitting your FAFSA, and we are here to help guide you through this process.”</p>

<p>To fill out a FAFSA, participants need completed 2021 tax returns and W-2 forms, plus an FSA ID, username and password for both the student and parent. Go to <a href="https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/sign-in/landing">studentaid.gov/fsa-id</a> to create an account and get FSA IDs.</p>
