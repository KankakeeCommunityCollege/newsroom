<p>Thank you to Kankakee Community College for sponsoring a successful blood drive. Our team registered 15 donors and they collected 15 units. Because of you and the generous KCC Community, up to 39 lives were saved and hundreds more were impacted by these gestures! And of the donors, TWELVE were NEW to Versiti! Thank you so much!</p>

<p>Donors: Please note that your gift card will be e-mailed to you within the next two weeks. If you have any questions you may contact <a href="mailto:msullivan@kcc.edu">msullivan@kcc.edu</a> for more information.</p>
