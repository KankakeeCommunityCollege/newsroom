<p>​KCC's Agri-Hort Technology program and Horticulture Club hosted Laura Lubben's 4<sup>th</sup> grade class from Manteno Elementary School on Friday, April 29.</p>

<p>The grade school students learned about three ways to grow plants: traditionally, in a hydroponics system, and in an aquaponics system.</p>

<p>After starting in the classroom, the group toured  KCC's greenhouse. The students finished their field trip by creating their own science experiment to take home. Each student planted a seed in potting mix and planted a seed in their own hydroponics system. </p>
