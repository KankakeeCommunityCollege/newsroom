<p>Effective May 13, KCC will address cybersecurity needs and requirements by college partners by requiring password changes every 90 days. As this policy begins, all users will receive a password change notification upon login on May 13.</p>

<p>New passwords must meet the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Eight character minimum.</li>
  <li>At least one upper case character, one lower case character, a number, and a special character. </li>
  <li>Cannot exceed two consecutive characters.</li>
  <li>Cannot contain the account name or parts of the user’s full name.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following rules will also apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Required password change every 90 days.</li>
  <li>Cannot use the last five previous passwords.</li>
  <li>Account will lock out for one hour after five failed attempts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cybersecurity is the responsibility of everyone using KCC’s computing resources. Having a secure, strong, password is fundamental in ensuring that our computing environment remains safe.</p>

<p>Here are password recommendations from KCC’s Information Technology Services Department. They can be used to assist in keeping all of your accounts secure.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a phrase. This makes your password easier to remember, and adds security because it will be longer.</li>
  <li>Use a unique password for each account.</li>
  <li>Avoid words that can be found in the dictionary.</li>
  <li>Avoid putting numbers at the end of your password.</li>
  <li>Don’t just change the number every time you change your password.</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyone with questions or concerns regarding this change can contact the ITS Help Desk at <a href="mailto:helpdesk@kcc.edu">helpdesk@kcc.edu</a>, or phone 815-802‑8900.</p>
