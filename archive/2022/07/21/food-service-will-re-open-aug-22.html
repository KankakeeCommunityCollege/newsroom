<p>We apologize for any inconvenience.</p>

<p>The following sources are still available: <br />•    College Center, offering soda machines and microwave;<br />•    Hammes Bookstore, offering snacks for sale; and<br />•    KCC Food Pantry, offering a variety of options to students in Room L114, 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. Monday through Thursday.</p>

<p>The final food truck visit for the summer was July 21.
