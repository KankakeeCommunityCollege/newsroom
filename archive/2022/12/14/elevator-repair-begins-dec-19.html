<p><img src="/uploads/2022/out-of-order-250x208.jpg" alt="" class="float-image-right" width="250" height="208" />KCC is completing essential updates to the West Elevator, beginning Dec. 19. It is expected to be closed until Jan. 6.</p>

<p>Use this <a href="http://www.kcc.edu/elevator2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website with maps and alternate routes</a> to get to the R Building and other destinations.</p>

<p>Here are a few other notes regarding this project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All staircases will be open.</li>
  <li>You won't be able to pass through the hallway by the west staircase (next to west elevator). That staircase will be accessible from the south (Health Careers/M Building side).</li>
  <li>The entrance that faces the west elevator will be closed. The entrance to Arts &amp; Sciences (R Building) a few feet away will be open.</li>
</ul>

<p>We apologize for any inconvenience.</p>
