<p><img src="/uploads/2022/gedclasses-350x526.jpg" alt="" class="float-image-right" width="350" height="526" />For Spring 2023, Kankakee Community College will offer GEDÂ® high school diploma preparation classes in Kankakee, Bradley and Watseka.</p>

<p>The free GED classes are offered at the KCC Riverfront Campus, the KCC North Extension Center in Bradley, the KCC South Extension Center in Watseka, and online. There is no cost to the student.</p>

<p>A KCC application, available at <a href="https://apply.kcc.edu">apply.kcc.edu</a>, is required to enroll. After an application is received, the program coordinator contacts students personally to make arrangements to attend the next available orientation session.</p>
