<p>On Thursday, Oct. 4, Kankakee Community College will host its Annual Fall Job Fair, including a special area designated for local manufacturers to celebrate National Manufacturing Month.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.kcc.edu/newsroom/job-fair-dscn5220.JPG" alt="" class="float-image-right" />The Job Fair will be from 9 a.m. - noon in the KCC College Center, and is open to the public. Veterans are encouraged to attend as well. Admission is free.</p>

<p>More than 50 businesses and industries will be at the Job Fair. Employers will conduct pre-screening interviews for full- and part-time positions. Manufacturers will be available to answer questions, accept applications/resumes, and to demonstrate their products.</p>

<p>“The Job Fair is an ideal setting for students, graduates, veterans and community members to learn more about area employers and current opportunities,” said Ken Crite, Coordinator of Career Services. “We want participants to dress professionally, bring resumes and to enjoy the experience of meeting employers from throughout the area.”</p>

<p>If participants need resumes, they are encouraged to visit KCC’s <a href="http://www.kcc.edu/coned/careerservices/pages/default.aspx">Career Services Center</a> for assistance before the event.</p>
