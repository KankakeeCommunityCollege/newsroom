  <p>The Continuing Education Department at Kankakee Community College is offering a seminar for social workers and counselors in September.</p>

  <p>“The First Six Session of Therapy” is designed to help practitioners increase first session attendance, engage clients in the first five minutes of contact, and increase attendance in future sessions.</p>

  <p>The presenter, Mark Sanders, said there is research which shows that clients make the most progress in the first six weeks of counseling, but most are no-shows at the second session. The seminar is designed to help turn around those statistics.</p>

  <p>Topics will include feedback informed counseling, behavioral couples counseling, motivational incentives and stage-based incentives. Sanders also will share information on how to accelerate progress through tasks and overcome resistance within the first three sessions of counseling.</p>

  <p>Sanders is an author and speaker on behavioral health issues. His presentations have reached thousands throughout the U.S., Europe, Canada, the Caribbean and British Islands.</p>

  <p>The seminar meets Friday, Sept. 14 from 8:30 a.m. - 4 p.m. at KCC in the Iroquois Room. Course no. is HLTH 438A.A13. Cost is $79, and includes handouts and 6 contact hours for nurses, nursing home administrators, social workers and counselors.</p>
