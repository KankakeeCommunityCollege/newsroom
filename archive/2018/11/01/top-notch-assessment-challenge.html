As part of the event, the high school student athletes also will take part in a 30-minute session on health awareness presented by KCC faculty who are certified nurses. Tips related to college life skills from an experienced college advisor also will be shared with the students.</p>

<p>Games begin at 11 a.m. and continue until the final contest, which will tip-off at 6 p.m. General admission is $10, and includes all six games. Fans can receive $5 off at the door by participating in a health assessment offered at the venue. Proceeds will benefit KCC.</p>
