<p>​In 2016, Natasha Rademacher was a student at KCC working toward a goal of becoming an occupational therapist.</p>

<p>She faced several barriers along the way due to reduced family income. Her family of four spent months struggling to pay bills and learned to live with the utilities shut off.  Providing food for her family had also become a challenge. When Rademacher confided about the situation to her KCC mentor, she was immediately referred to the <a href="https://foundation.kcc.edu">KCC Foundation</a>. Through assistance from the <a href="https://foundation.kcc.edu/give/womens-giving-circle/">Women’s Giving Circle</a>, Rademacher and her family were assisted with their utility bills and provided gift cards for food.  Through her hard work and with the assistance of the Foundation, Rademacher graduated from KCC in May 2017.</p>

<p>Today,Rademacher is doing well and has never forgot the impact the Foundation had on her life. She has committed to give back by hosting a Scentsy fundraiser to benefit the Foundation. Order can be made through <a href="https://kaylindex.scentsy.us/party/9973936/kcc-foundation-fund-raiser">Rademacher’s fundraiser page</a>.   Her entire commission will be donated to the Foundation to benefit unmet and emerging needs at KCC.</p>
