<p>“Take a second look,” Pino says in her artist’s statement. “This is what I tell people when they view my work. The textures I create, those optical layers, are built with the intent to lure the eye to travel deeper within. As a result, one may be able to find deeper metaphorical meaning as well.</p>

<p>“I believe that a work of art lacks substance if it has not encountered a speed bump or two during its creation. The same philosophy applies to my life. That is why I firmly believe that my life experiences are relevant tools for my creative process. I combine personal experience with bouts into the fictional.”</p>

<p>The exhibit will be on display Nov. 7 to Dec. 7, 2018 in the Art Department Gallery, Room R103, at KCC. A reception at the gallery will be Thursday, Nov. 8 from 10-11 a.m. in conjunction with the <a href="https://news.kcc.edu/2018/10/29/veterans-day-events-2018.html">KCC Veteran’s Appreciation Ceremony</a>, which begins at 11 a.m. the same day. The veteran’s ceremony will be in KCC’s Harold and Jean Miner Memorial Library, lower level.</p>

She was activated in relief of the 2008 Missouri Floods.<br />Pino has a bachelor’s degree in fine arts from the University of Wisconsin, Madison (2011) and a Certificate in Museum Studies from Northwestern University (2018).
