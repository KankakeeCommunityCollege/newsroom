  <p>Nov. 12-16 is <a href="https://iew.state.gov/">International Education Week</a> - a joint initiative of the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Education used to celebrate the benefits of international education and exchange worldwide.</p>

  <p>Did you know:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>KCC has international students from Australia, Brazil, Germany, Israel, South Korea, Trinidad and Tobago, and Vietnam.</li>
    <li>KCC has a <a href="https://www.kcc.edu/student-resources/student-life/clubs/#global-awareness-club">Global Awareness Club</a> which strives to educate and raise awareness of international culture to create a student-centered group on diversity issues.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>There are several benefits to international education including, but not limited to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>International students foster a diverse campus environment and enhance learning by offering different cultural perspectives.</li>
    <li>International students can broaden domestic students’ cultural views and perceptions, promoting understanding, inclusiveness and respect. This global view is beneficial in an increasingly connected world.</li>
    <li>The Association of International Educators’ (NAFSA) <a href="https://www.nafsa.org/_/File/_/infographic_econ_value_2017.pdf">latest analysis</a> finds that the 1,078,822 international students studying at U.S. colleges and universities contributed $36.9 billion and supported more than 450,000 jobs to the U.S. economy during the 2016-17 academic year (NAFSA, 2016). NAFSA is the world’s largest nonprofit association dedicated to international education and exchange.</li>
    <li>By studying in the U.S., international students broaden their worldview, experience the U.S. student lifestyle, can choose from a broad range of programs, gain experience in their field of study, and make diverse friendships.</li>
  </ul>
