  <p>The seminar will have two presentations, and participants can attend one or both. Registration is not required.</p>

  <p>“LinkedIn: A Student’s Fast Track to Internships and Jobs” will be from 10 a.m. - noon.</p>

  <p>“If you’re interested in quickly and easily creating a strong LinkedIn presence and growing a network that will open doors, this class is for you,” Breitbarth said.</p>

  <p>Topics relate to using LinkedIn to finding a job, including creating a winning profile, tapping into a database of resources, developing a network, the best keywords, and connecting with school alumni to locate opportunities.</p>

  <p>“The Power Formula for LinkedIn Success” will be from 1:30-3:30 p.m.</p>

  <p>“This class has something for everyone,” Breitbarth said. “Whether you’re a social media novice or savvy user, you’ll come away with action steps that can produce immediate results.”</p>

  <p>Topics will include using your experience and relationships to meet your business and career goals, creating a compelling profile that helps the right people find you, successfully searches, engaging with LinkedIn members who can help you, and using hidden LinkedIn features to generate opportunities.</p>
