  <p><br />KCC’s veteran’s services team has passed a Veteran’s Affairs audit with flying colors.</p>
  <p>The Federal VA audit resulted in no issues, with no findings.</p>

  <p>The college expects to receive an official letter to confirm the results within the next month.</p>

  <p>“This is a team effort, as many of us work with the veterans; completing vouchers, registering them, approving degree audits, certifying, payments, etc.,” said Deanna Liacone, director of financial aid. Liacone made special mention of contributions made by Kendra Souligne, coordinator in the Financial Aid Office; Michele Buikema, administrative assistant for the Information/Finance Office; and Vanessa Lopez, specialist II in the Financial Aid Office.</p>
