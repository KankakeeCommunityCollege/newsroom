<p>Here’s how it works:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Courses most likely to fill are identified by the college’s academic associate deans.</li>
  <li>Waitlists become available to students when course sections are full. Students can join the waitlist in <a href="https://selfservice.kcc.edu/Student/">Student Planning</a>.</li>
  <li>If a seat becomes available, the first student on the waitlist will be notified via KCC email of the opportunity to register for the section.</li>
  <li>The student has 24 hours to register for the section.</li>
  <li>If 24 hours passes, the next person on the waitlist will be notified.</li>
</ol>

<p>For more detailed information, please contact an academic advisor or the director of admissions and registration.</p>
