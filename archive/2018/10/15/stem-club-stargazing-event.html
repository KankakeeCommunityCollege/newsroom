<p>The <a href="http://www.kcc.edu/students/studentlife/clubs/Pages/stem-club.aspx">KCC STEM Club</a> had a cookout and stargazing event on Monday, Oct. 8.</p>

<p>STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math.</p>

<p>The event started at the East Pavilion. Fun was had with Frisbees, good food, and meeting Dr. Jessica Greminger’s new baby. Greminger is one of the club’s sponsors.</p>

<p>Then, as darkness fell, the group went out to the middle of KCC’s golf course, set up the KCC telescope and checked out Mars.</p>

<p>“We tried to get Saturn, too, but it went behind some trees!” said Michael Caparula, one of the club’s sponsors.</p>
