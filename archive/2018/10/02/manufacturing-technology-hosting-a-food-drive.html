<p>Kankakee Community College’s Manufacturing Technology program is hosting a food drive during October to benefit the college’s Food Pantry.</p>

<p>Non-perishable and canned items will be accepted. Especially welcome are “grab-and-go” options for a quick meal or snack, such as ramen noodle cups, macaroni and cheese cups, popcorn, cereal, granola bars or fruit cups. See the complete recommended <a href="https://www.kcc.edu/students/studentlife/Documents/Food-Pantry-donations.pdf" target="_blank">list</a>.</p>

<p>Donation bins are located on KCC’s Riverfront Campus, outside Rooms L340 and W102; and at the entrance of the Manufacturing and Industrial Technology Center (MITC).</p>

<p>October is Manufacturing Month, and National <a href="https://www.mfgday.com/">MFG DAY</a> is Friday, Oct. 5. These observances are designed to give manufacturers an opportunity to open their doors and show, in a coordinated effort, what manufacturing is, and isn’t.</p>

<p>KCC’s Manufacturing Technology program offers certificates and associate in applied science degrees, with specializations in Machine Tool; Welding; Industrial Maintenance; and Transportation, Warehousing, Distribution and Logistics (TWDL).</p>

<p>More information about the program is online, or phone Mark Anderson, program coordinator, at 815-802-8873.</p>
