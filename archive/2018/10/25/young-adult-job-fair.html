<p>The Job Fair will be from 3-5 p.m. at the <a href="http://www.kcc.edu/nec">KCC North Extension Center</a>, 450 N. Kinzie Ave. in Bradley.</p>

<p>“This is an opportunity for young adults to connect with local employers, and gain job search experience,” said Ken Crite, KCC coordinator of career services. “Employers will share what they are looking for and conduct pre-screening interviews.”</p>

<p>Job seekers attending the event should dress well, as if they are going to an interview, Crite said. Dressing appropriately is a good way to show employers they are serious about being professional, he added.</p>

<p>More than 10 businesses will be at the Job Fair. If participants need resumes, they are encouraged to visit <a href="http://www.kcc.edu/coned/careerservices/Pages/default.aspx">KCC’s Career Services Center</a> for assistance before the event.</p>

<p>The Job Fair is sponsored by the <a href="http://www.kcc.edu/future/yaps/Pages/default.aspx">KCC Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Young Adult Program</a>, which is funded by the Grundy Livingston Kankakee Workforce Board. For additional information, phone 815-802-8222 or email <a href="mailto:kcrite@kcc.edu">kcrite@kcc.edu</a>.</p>
