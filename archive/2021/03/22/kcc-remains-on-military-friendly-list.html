<p>Kankakee Community College is one of only 15 Illinois community colleges selected for the 2021 Guide to Military Friendly Schools, published in conjunction with “G.I. Jobs” magazine.<br /><br /><img src="/uploads/Jason_RodriguezDSC_0202-Copy.jpg" alt="" class="float-image-left" width="279" height="349" />“Kankakee Community College has given me the opportunity to really enjoy my college journey,” said Jason Rodriguez, a member of the Illinois Army National Guard. “I have had the best experience possible. What really impacted my time was the culture of caring exuded by the KCC staff.  <br /><br />“When I first came to KCC, college was difficult for me and Veteran services was new, but with the help of the Veterans Association, Kendra (Souligne), and the faculty, I felt very welcome at KCC,” Rodriguez continued. “I remember when I first walked up to the financial aid counter, a member of the Veteran’s Association welcomed me, showed me the Veteran Resource Center and gave me a tour of KCC. I knew from there I would have numerous resources to help while here at KCC and even in my future endeavors. Whenever I have the opportunity, I recommend KCC, especially to military-connected individuals in the community.”<br /><br />Typically, KCC has about 65 veterans who enroll each year, according to the college’s Office of Financial Aid. Among veterans, there are 31 KCC student veterans currently utilizing VA Education benefits. <br /><br />"KCC is proud to be designated as a Military Friendly School,” said Kendra Souligne, coordinator of financial aid and veterans services. “We are committed to assisting those who served or are currently serving in the U.S. military and their family members as they transition into the college setting.<br /><br />“Our main role is to guide them in utilizing their federal and state VA (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs) educational benefits and financial aid. We also offer referral sources within the community and state to assist them with benefits beyond education."<br /><br />In 2016, KCC opened the Veteran’s Resource Center offering resources such as computers, a meeting area, a lounge, and a Vet Center student assistant.<br /><br />“The KCC Veterans Association, an approved chapter of Student Veterans of America, provides a community atmosphere, camaraderie, a gateway to leadership development, and accessibility to benefits,” Souligne said. <br /><br />The <a href="Kankakee Community College is one of only 15 Illinois community colleges selected for the 2021 Guide to Military Friendly Schools, published in conjunction with “G.I.

The military friendly schools list has 26 Illinois colleges on it.  According to Victory Media, which publishes “GI Jobs,” schools were evaluated using both public data sources and responses from its own survey. “Schools who achieve designation show true commitment and dedication in their efforts,” said Kayla Lopez, National Director of Military Partnerships for Military Friendly. “Our standards assist schools by providing a benchmark that promotes positive educational outcomes, resources, and support services that better the educational landscape and provide opportunity for the Military Community.” The 2021-22 Military Friendly® Schools list will be published in the May issue of G.I. Jobs magazine and at militaryfriendly.com. For more information about educational benefits for military veterans, spouses and dependents, visit kcc.edu/veterans.
