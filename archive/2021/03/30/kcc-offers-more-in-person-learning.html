<p>For the summer term and fall semester in 2021, KCC is moving back to mostly in-person learning. <br /> <br />This means that classes will be offered on-site and will be led by professors in classrooms. It’s a change welcomed by many students, including sophomore Ariana Ramirez from Gilman. <br /> <br /><img src="/uploads/ariana-ramirez-dsc-1101.jpg" alt="" class="float-image-left" width="250" height="312" />“Returning to in-person classes is essential for students to perform to the best of their ability and demonstrate their full potential,” said Ramirez. “Some students, including myself, need more face-to-face interaction to be able to fully understand the material and have guidance in a course. We want something to look forward to such as a chance to be more involved with student life events and enjoy our experience at the college.”<br /> <br />As it did before the pandemic, the college will offer a number of online and hybrid (both online and in-person components) classes. <br /> <br />“We know that some students thrive in the online environments,” said Dr. Kiana Battle, vice president for Academic Affairs. “Those classes offer flexibility and will remain as an option. But we’re happy to move toward a learning environment where in-person is the norm, and there are plentiful opportunities for discussion, socialization, tutoring, counseling and other resources.”<br />  <br />This summer, six-week and eight-week options are available, and classes begin the week of May 24. New students can get started at<a href="https://summer.kcc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">summer.kcc.edu</a>, and returning students can register at <a href="https://my.kcc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my.kcc.edu</a>.</p>

<p>The college is continuing its precautions to clean and sanitize classrooms and other campus spaces. It also has kept mask, physical distancing and a requirement to complete a daily assessment before entering a college facility.</p>

<p>Summer registration is underway, and fall registration begins April 12. <br /> </p>
