<p><em>Following is a message to KCC students from Ariana Ramirez, the Student Advisory Council president and student representative to the board of trustees. </em></p>

<p>First and foremost, Happy New Year, and welcome returning and new students to Spring Semester 2021! Hoping you all had the happiest of holidays and are ready to get back into the swing of things!<br /><br />While it is important to do well in the classroom (or virtual classroom), there are additional opportunities outside of the classroom that can aid in your success as a student and life-long learner.<br /><br />To introduce myself, my name is Ariana Ramirez, and I’m a sophomore here at KCC. It is my pleasure to serve as your 2020-21 Student Trustee and your 2020-21 Student Advisory Council President.<br /><br />Do not fall into the belief that your voice does not matter. I am here to assist you find your voice, and to ensure your needs and opinions do matter. As your Student Trustee, I serve as the voice of the student body, both locally and state-wide. During the first week of March, I will also host an in-person and virtual “Spill the Tea with the Student Trustee” forum where students have an opportunity to meet with me, ask me questions, obtain information, and/or express your challenges or concerns.<br /><br />As president of the Student Advisory Council, I encourage you to start or join a student club, or participate in one of the many social, recreational, leadership, diversity, community service or wellness programs offered throughout the semester.<br />I challenge you to voice your opinion, get connected, and get involved!
