<p><img src="https://cdn.kcc.edu/newsroom/2021/fitting-cloth-facemask-small.png" alt="" class="float-image-right" width="285" height="185" />KCC is open. Spring 2021 classes have started, and some are in-person for at least one session.</p>

<p>Everyone who visits KCC (faculty, staff and students) are reminded that masks are required, and should be worn properly.</p>

<p>Masks should cover your nose and mouth and fit snugly to your face. If you need a few tips, please check out<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these CDC guidelines</a>.</p>
