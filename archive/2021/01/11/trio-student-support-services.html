<p>One way students can thrive in college is through job shadowing opportunities to learn more about their future careers.</p>

<p>KCC’s <a href="http://www.kcc.edu/trio">TRIO Student Support Services</a> program offers TRIO Career Coach, a job shadowing experience for students to apply what they’ve learned in the classroom to a real workplace setting.</p>

<p>“This experience makes students more marketable during their job search and helps them create a professional network,” said Keisha Smith, assistant director of the TRIO Student Support Services program.</p>

<p>LoRyelle Robinson, a TRIO participant, began job shadowing with the KCC Police Department on Jan. 4. Under the leadership of Chief Eric Springer, Robinson is learning about the daily responsibilities of a police officer, including how to write traffic reports and tickets, how to communicate using the codes of police and emergency personnel. She is also learning how to respond during scenarios that require the intervention of police officers.</p>

<p>“Through this experience, LoRyelle will learn what to expect when she’s employed in law enforcement,” Chief Springer explained.</p>

<p>Robinson plans to transfer to a university next fall and pursue a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice.</p>
