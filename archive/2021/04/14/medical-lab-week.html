<p>“Medical laboratory professionals want the public to know that they are critical members of the health care team,” said Glenda Forneris, director of KCC’s Medical Laboratory Technology programs.  “Almost everyone has had a medical lab test, yet most people are unaware that trained professional perform those tests.  Laboratory professionals spend countless hours dedicated to accurate testing to assist in important diagnoses and deliver results that can literally save lives.”<br /><br />According to the American Society for Clinical Laboratory Sciences, “The dedicated efforts of laboratory professionals are often unseen by the general public. With the public now demanding the assurance of quality health care and professional accountability, laboratory practitioners of this critical science have a responsibility to ensure that the public is well informed about clinical laboratory competency.”<br /><br />KCC offers a <a href="https://kcc.smartcatalogiq.com/current/Academic-Catalog/Programs-of-Study-by-Area/Health-Careers/Medical-Laboratory-Technology-AAS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two-year Medical Laboratory Technology associate degree</a> program.  Graduates of this program are eligible to take the national certification exam given by the American Society of Clinical pathology and other certifying agencies.  The program’s pass rate is 97% for the last three years; well above the national average!<br /><a href="https://youtu.be/rCyvSKhqkZ8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here’s a video about the program</a>. <br /><br />KCC also offers two certificate programs, <a href="https://kcc.smartcatalogiq.com/current/Academic-Catalog/Programs-of-Study-by-Area/Health-Careers/Medical-Laboratory-Assistant-Certificate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medical Laboratory Assistant</a> and <a href="https://kcc.smartcatalogiq.com/current/Academic-Catalog/Programs-of-Study-by-Area/Health-Careers/Phlebotomy-Certificate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phlebotomy</a>.<br /><br />For more information on a career in medical laboratory technology, contact Forneris at 815-802-8835 or email <a href="mailto:gforneris@kcc.edu">gforneris@kcc.edu</a>.</p>
