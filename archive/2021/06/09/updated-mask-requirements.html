<p>Following guidance from the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Centers for Disease Control</a>, the <a href="https://www.illinoispolicy.org/illinois-reopens-june-11-but-keeps-those-masks-handy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">governor’s office</a> and the <a href="https://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19/community-guidance/recommendations-fully-vaccinated" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Illinois Department of Public Health</a>, KCC is revising its mask requirement.  </p>

<p>Beginning Friday, June 11, individuals who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 will no longer be required to wear a mask while at college facilities, both indoors and outside. This adjustment follows announcements from the CDC and IDPH which indicate that the COVID-19 vaccine provides effective protection against the virus. Therefore, those vaccinated can remove their masks in most settings. </p>

<p>This change does not extend to unvaccinated individuals, who should <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continue to wear a mask</a> while on college property. </p>

<p>KCC will depend on the integrity of students and staff to follow the requirements based on their individual vaccine status. </p>

<p>For those who have not done so already, the college also recommends <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting a COVID-19 vaccine</a> – for both the health benefits and the flexibility it now provides while at the college and in the community.</p>

<p>Please note: Also on June 11, the requirement to complete a self-assessment before entering a KCC facility is being removed for everyone.</p>
