The box has enough to share with a friend or a date. Everyone will get to enjoy a number of delectable tastes, sights and sounds during the tour.”</p>

<p>The cost is $79, and includes a box of pastries and chocolates large enough to share, and the educational seminar/virtual tour. Deadline to register is Feb. 22.</p>
