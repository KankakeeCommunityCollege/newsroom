<p>The <a href="https://continuinged.kcc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Continuing Education Department</a> at Kankakee Community College is offering a “Churches &amp; Chocolate” virtual tour.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.kcc.edu/newsroom/2021/Churches-Chocolates-compress.png" alt="" class="float-image-right" width="475" height="525" />During the Churches &amp; Chocolate Tour on Tuesday, March 30 from 7-8:30 p.m., participants will virtually visit three churches in the “City of Steeples,” Milwaukee. Plus, every participant will receive a box of delectable chocolates to indulge in during the event.</p>

<p>“Even while remaining physically distant, this tour promises a lot of fun,” said Deb Hoyer-Denson, KCC’s assistant director of continuing education. “Participants will satisfy all their senses because indulgent chocolates are mailed ahead of the event. When you add in tours of the beautiful churches, historical information and stories, plus a chance for discussion as it all happens, this is a unique and enjoyable way to spend the evening.”  </p>

<p>The event includes docent-led virtual tours showcasing the history and architecture of three unique places of worship in Milwaukee. It also offers live discussion, photos and high-quality pre-filmed segments. </p>

<p>All participants will receive a box of chocolates—large enough to share— from Indulgence Chocolatiers. Participants can take part in a guided chocolate tasting at the beginning of the virtual presentation, Denson said.</p>

<p>“A chocolatier will describe the chocolates in the box, where they were made, along with special techniques that went into them, flavors that pair well with each, and more,” she said.</p>

<p>The cost is $79, and includes a box of chocolates large enough to share, and the educational seminar/virtual tour. Deadline to register is March 16.</p>

<p>“Churches and Chocolates” also make a great gift or care package for a friend who loves travelling! To purchase this as a gift, phone 815-802-8206.</p>
