<p>The recent vaccine mandate from Illinois Gov. Pritzker includes all higher education students and employeesâ€“including
  KCC.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.kcc.edu/newsroom/2021/vax-verification.svg" alt="" class="float-image-right" width="120" height="150"/>Those who are vaccinated are asked to submit the<a href="https://form.jotform.com/212384579044965" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccination verification form</a> by the Sept. 19 deadline. If you already submitted your verification, thank you!
</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.kcc.edu/newsroom/2021/vaccine-reminder-small.jpg" alt="" class="float-image-left" width="150" height="150"/>If you are not already vaccinated, please consider making an appointment this week to receive the first dose of a two-dose COVID-19 vaccination series or a single-dose vaccination by Sept. 19. Second doses of the vaccine must be received within 30 days after the first dose.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind, most KCC students who are vaccinated qualify for a free KCC class. This is up to a $495 value! <a href="https://news.kcc.edu/archive/2021/08/02/vaccinated-claim-a-free-class/">Full details are here</a>.</p>
<p>Those who are not vaccinated by Sept. 19 must be tested weekly for COVID-19. KCC is working toward offering free on-site testing through a third-party vendor (saliva-based PCR tests). Details of how to follow the weekly testing protocol are in the works and will be communicated as soon as they are available.</p>
<p>We want to keep moving forward, and in this case, moving forward might not be simple. Thank you to students and employees for your understanding as we implement these required changes.</p>
<p>KCC will continue to keep information up-to-date on the <a href="https://coronavirus.kcc.edu">coronavirus.kcc.edu</a> website. Please send questions using the <a href="https://coronavirus.kcc.edu/contact-us/">KCC Coronavirus contact us</a> form.</p>
