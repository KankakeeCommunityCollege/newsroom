<p>KCC is hosting workshops to help college-bound students and their parents understand the financial aid and
  scholarship process. Staff also will explain and clarify the types of aid which are available.</p>
<p>Each workshop includes how to fill out the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid), the form used at all
  two- and four-year colleges and universities to determine eligibility for federal and state grants, work-study
  programs, subsidized &amp; unsubsidized student loans and some scholarships. On Oct. 5, there will also be information
  about KCC scholarships.</p>
<p>The schedule is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tuesday, Oct. 5, 6-8 p.m. in KCC Room M120</li>
  <li>Thursday, Oct. 21, 6-8 p.m. in KCC Room M120</li>
  <li>Wednesday, Nov. 3, 6-8 p.m. in KCC Room M120</li>
  <li>Tuesday, Dec. 7, 6-8 p.m. in KCC Room M120</li>
</ul>
<p>All sessions are provided as a public service and are open to students and parents regardless of the college they
  plan to attend.</p>
<p>The FAFSA becomes available Oct. 1. Applications for 2022-23 scholarships at KCC become available on Oct. 1.</p>
<p>“We recommend that everyone complete the FAFSA as soon as possible because most funds are distributed on a
  first-come, first-served basis,” said Kendra Souligne, KCC assistant director of financial aid. “Even if your plans
  aren’t finalized, your financial aid package starts with submitting a FAFSA.”</p>
<p><strong>In-person participants</strong> will be asked to follow KCC’s procedures, including wearing a face covering
  and completing a <a href="https://certify.kcc.edu/">certification form</a>.</p>
