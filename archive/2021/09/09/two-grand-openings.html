  The library underwent a major renovation in 2020, and re-opened in Fall 2020. The
  library is now an area dedicated to collaboration and information sharing. It offers opportunities to engage with a
  variety of technology as well as areas for quiet study. The mezzanine level is the Student Success Center, with
  tutoring and an active learning classroom.
