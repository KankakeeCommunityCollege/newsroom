<p>Some online services - including Self-Service - will not be available from 5 p.m. on Thursday, Sept. 30 - 11:59 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 3.</p>
<p>Self-service includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Statements and bill payment.</li>
  <li>Searching for courses, class schedules and registration.</li>
  <li>Viewing grades.</li>
  <li>Your personal financial aid information (<a href="https://www.kcc.edu/tuition-and-aid/financial-aid/">www.kcc.edu/financialaid</a> will still be active).</li>
</ul>
<p>This downtime will enable the college to migrate existing data to new servers.</p>
<p>For the most part, <a href="https://www.kcc.edu">www.kcc.edu</a> will still be operational. Only web pages connected to the system being migrated will be affected. Also not affected: <a href="https://kcc.instructure.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canvas</a> and the <a href="https://kcc.smartcatalogiq.com/current/Academic-Catalog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KCC Catalog</a>.</p>
<p>We apologize for any inconvenience.</p>
