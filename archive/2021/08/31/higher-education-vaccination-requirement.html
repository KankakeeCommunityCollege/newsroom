<p>On Aug. 26, Illinois Gov. Pritzker announced <a href="https://www.illinois.gov/news/press-release.23808.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new vaccine requirements</a> for higher education students and employees, including KCC. KCC is in the process of implementing changes to meet the requirements. </p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.kcc.edu/newsroom/2021/vax-verification.svg" alt="" class="float-image-right" width="120" height="150" />Those who are vaccinated can complete KCC's <a href="https://form.jotform.com/212384579044965">vaccine verification form</a>.</p>

<p>KCC students and employees who do not receive the vaccine must be tested for COVID-19 once per week, once testing becomes available at KCC. It will be saliva-based testing. The college is working to implement testing as soon as possible. If there is a gap between the governor's vaccination deadline and the date when KCC can offer testing, all students can still come to campus during that time. </p>

<p>Weekly tests will be free.</p>

<p>After being offered at the Riverfront Campus, testing will later expand to extension centers. That information will be communicated as it becomes available.</p>

<p>Most KCC students who are vaccinated qualify for a free class from KCC. This is worth up to $495, which will be a credit on your account. <a href="https://news.kcc.edu/archive/2021/08/02/vaccinated-claim-a-free-class/">Read all details here</a>.</p>

<p>Access to college facilities will not be limited while the testing process is put in place. All students can come to the college and should continue to <a href="https://certify.kcc.edu">certify</a>, social distance and wear masks.</p>

<p>The most up-to-date information, and more details, are on KCC's <a href="https://coronavirus.kcc.edu">Coronavirus Response page</a> and <a href="https://coronavirus.kcc.edu/faq/">Coronavirus FAQ page</a>.</p>
