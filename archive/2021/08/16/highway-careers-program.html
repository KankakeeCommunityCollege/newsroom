<p>Kankakee Community College has openings for the next session of the Highway Construction Careers Training Program. Program orientations are offered Aug. 24, 25 and 26. The class begins Monday, Sept. 13.</p>

<p>During training, participants receive stipends of $10 per hour, which does not affect unemployment benefits. Work boots, tools and protective equipment also are provided.</p>

<p>For more information or to choose an orientation session, phone Smith at 815-802-8205 or email <a href="mailto:agsmith@kcc.edu">agsmith@kcc.edu</a>.</p>

<p>Participants must have a valid Illinois driver's license, be 18 years or older, be drug-free, have a high school diploma or GED, and be interested in working in the construction trades.</p>

<p>The program is open to all qualified individuals, but is designed to increase the number of women, minorities and disadvantaged individuals working on Illinois Department of Transportation highway construction projects.</p>

<p>The Highway Construction Careers Training Program is funded by IDOT and administered by the Illinois Community College Board. The training also emphasizes life-long learning and provides opportunities for further education and assistance to improve employability in Illinois’ highway construction industry. IDOT, ICCB and KCC do not guarantee employment upon a trainees’ graduation from the program.</p>
