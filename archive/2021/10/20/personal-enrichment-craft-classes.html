<p>In <strong>“Aromatherapy Accessories”</strong> participants will create four fashionable aromatherapy accessories: a bracelet (up to 11 inches long), sized for a man or a woman: a key fob; vent clips for a car and office; and a holiday ornament. Lava stone and wood beads will hold essential oils when you finish. Class meets Thursday, Nov. 18 from 6-9 p.m. at KCC in Room D151. Instructor is Dawn Wrobel.
