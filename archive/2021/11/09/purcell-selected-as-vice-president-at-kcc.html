  Meredith Purcell was confirmed as the college's newest vice president by the KCC board of trustees at its meeting
  Monday, Nov. 8. She is the college's chief student affairs officer, responsible for areas including enrollment
  management, student activities, support services, recruitment, advisement, financial aid, testing services and
  athletics. Purcell's new job is effective immediately.

  “In recent years at KCC, Meredith has been integral
  to the college's progress toward re-energizing approaches to student engagement, support, and development,” said Dr.
  Michael Boyd, KCC president. “For example, she has led efforts to modernize recruitment and retention efforts, she has
  championed the design and implementation of our Cav Days freshman orientation, and she has secured partnerships which
  connect our students to the mental health resources which are so important to their academic progress.
</p>
<p>
  “I'm
  excited about the opportunity to work with Meredith in her new role, and I'm even more excited to know that the
  college will continue to see the dynamic progress and momentum we've experienced in recent years as we've worked to
  re-focus KCC's student engagement efforts.”

  A KCC employee since January 2008, Purcell has held various
  student-focused positions, and was most recently director of student success. She has also served as director of
  advisement services/counseling and academic advisor at KCC.

  “I want to thank Dr. Boyd, the search
  committee, and the board of trustees for placing their trust in me to continue to serve the KCC community as vice
  president for student affairs,” Purcell said. “In almost 14 years at KCC, I have been dedicated to assisting students
  in achieving their educational and career goals. I am excited to lead our talented student affairs team in working
  with our faculty and staff to provide the quality services and programs our students need to thrive and
  succeed.”

  Before working at KCC, Purcell was assistant director of student affairs at Rush University in
  Chicago. She also has worked at University of Illinois at Chicago and Kishwaukee College in Malta.

  Purcell
  has a master's degree in counseling from the College of Education at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb; and a
  bachelor's degree in education, with a major in applied psychology, from St. Cloud State University in
  Minnesota.<br />Before Purcell, the most recent chief student services officer at the college was Dr. Jose da Silva,
  who left the college in July to accept a position at University of North Texas at Dallas.
