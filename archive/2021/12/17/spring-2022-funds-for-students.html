<p>There are several ways for students to save a lot (or get <strong>FREE TUITION</strong>) by attending Kankakee
  Community College. </p>
<p>Details on the American Rescue Plan, One Workforce Grant, the Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act – and more –
  are here.</p>
<p><strong>American Rescue Plan</strong></p>
<p>KCC received $3.2 million in financial assistance from the American Rescue Plan to pass directly to students. Money
  will be distributed based on need and verification of enrollment. These awards do not impact a students' eligibility
  for other federal student aid, such as the Pell grant. These awards do not have to be paid back.</p>

<p><strong>Vaccinated? Claim a FREE class</strong></p>
<p>KCC is offering a free class during Spring 2022 to anyone who brings in their vaccination card and student ID, as
  long as they didn't receive the incentive last fall (Fall 2021). Details and exceptions are in a <a
    href="https://news.kcc.edu/2022/01/04/vaccinated-claim-a-free-class.html"
  >separate newsroom article</a>.</p>
<p><strong>One Workforce Grant</strong></p>
<p>A new grant called One Workforce from the U.S. Department of Labor can pay for tuition, fees, books (and more) for
  students in many of KCC's manufacturing, welding and electrical engineering technology programs. To qualify, you must
  live in northeast Illinois or northwest Indiana, be 17 or older, not in high school, and unemployed or underemployed.
  People from underrepresented groups can also qualify. Even if you are already employed, you may be eligible.</p>
