In the spirit of offering something for everyone, Kankakee Community College is introducing a new program for those who are taking a break from college.

![](/uploads/2022/gapyearlogo254x286.jpg){: .float-image-right width="254" height="286"}The [Gap Year Program](uploads/2022/GapYearPDF-withlink.pdf) will offer career exploration and activities in a low-pressure, no homework environment.

“Studies have shown that 80% of college students end up changing their major at least once,” said Cesar Avalos, coordinator of workforce opportunities at KCC. “KCC’s Gap year program is designed to narrow down their career path by exploring their passions and interests through practical exercises. Thus, saving them valuable time and resources that would have been spent taking unnecessary coursework.”

Sessions will be held every week from Sept. 19 to Dec. 12. Career areas that will be reviewed are agriculture-horticulture; business; computer graphic technology; industrial engineering and welding; health careers; law enforcement; air-conditioning and refrigeration; Electrical Engineering Technology and Renewable Energy; Math, Science and Engineering; and Liberal Arts.

There will also be information about utilizing KCC’s Charlton Career Services Center and about the state-funded Highway Construction Careers Training Program.

In addition to people taking a break from college, Avalos said the Gap Year program also will be a good fit for undecided students, anyone considering a career change, or other adults who are curious about college options.

There is no charge for participants. The registration deadline is Sept. 12.
