The tradition of celebrating Independence Day with live music followed by fireworks will continue Thursday, July 4 along the south banks of the Kankakee River.

The event will include three live music performances. Kankakee Community College gates open at 4:30 p.m., and admission is $20 per carload. All proceeds benefit the [Kankakee Valley Symphony Orchestra](http://www.kvso.org). Food concessions will also be available beginning at 4:30 p.m. Vendors will be Jimmy Jo’s BBQ, Martinez Tacos, Oberweis Ice Cream and Kankakee Valley Youth Symphony Orchestra Concessions.

All groups will be performing American and patriotic music. The schedule of events includes the Kankakee Valley Youth Symphony Orchestra concert at 5:30 p.m.; the Kankakee Municipal Band at 6:30 p.m.; and the Kankakee Valley Symphony Orchestra concert at 7:30 p.m. The symphony concert will feature KCC President Dr. Michael Boyd narrating a special presentation of “Casey at the Bat.” Fireworks will begin at dusk, approximately 9 p.m.

The fireworks show will be approximately 25 minutes long. The KVSO symphony concert is underwritten by Riverside Medical Center and the Illinois Arts Council. Kankakee Valley Park District, the City of Kankakee and KCC are also sponsors.

On the KCC grounds, picnicking is welcomed, and indoor restrooms are available. Concertgoers are encouraged to bring chairs and blankets; no seating is provided. KCC’s grounds are handicap accessible. Grills and personal fireworks, including sparklers, are not permitted.

KCC is located at 100 College Drive, off River Road, south of downtown Kankakee.

Originally known as the Society for Friends of Music, KVSO was established in 1967 for the purpose of experiencing the joy of music together. Today the KVSOA Board of Directors, the Kankakee Valley Youth Symphony, The KVSO Women’s Guild, and the KVSO Foundation all make up the Kankakee Valley Symphony Orchestra Association.
