Although the new version of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for is having a bumpy rollout, KCCâ€™s Office of Financial Aid is continuing to assist current and potential students through the financial aid process.

The new FAFSA is to apply for aid during the upcoming 2024-25 school year.

One issue is a delay in schools receiving FAFSA data, said Kendra Souligne, KCC's director of Financial Aid. The timeline for processing applications and providing aid offers to students for 2024-25 is considerably impacted and delayed, she said.

"The FAFSA is used across the nation, so applicants everywhere are being affected," Souligne said. "Even with the issues, we want to make sure students know we are more than happy to help them get their FAFSA submitted and assist with their questions or concerns."

Souligne said members of the Financial Aid team are ready to help, and they are aware of ongoing challenges that many applicants are facing.&nbsp;
