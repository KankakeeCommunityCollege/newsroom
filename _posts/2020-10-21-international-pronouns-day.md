Oct. 21 is International Pronouns Day.

In honor of this day, KCC's Equity, Diversity & Inclusion Center has created a [flier with links](/Pronouns-Day-2020.pdf) to an educational article and a video.

"Proper use of pronouns makes our campus more inclusive," said Whitney Mittons, KCC coordinator of equity, diversity and inclusion.
