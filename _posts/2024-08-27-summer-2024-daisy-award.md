The annual award is part of the DAISY Foundation’s mission to express gratitude to nurses with programs that recognize them for the extraordinary, compassionate and skillful care they provide patients and families.

Pardy, a Watseka resident, was nominated during her final semester at KCC by a patient she cared for while doing a clinical rotation at Riverside Medical Center.

“It was nice to see Tori’s smiling and familiar face come into my room,” the nominating patient said. “She reminded me that we had met at Riverside in Watseka when I was coming in for chemo. I never saw anything but a smile and concern for the patients. She went beyond just checking the vitals, making sure I was comfortable and pain free. If she couldn’t help me herself, she would let the nurse know what was going on. Tori seems to have the capabilities with willingness to learn, show concern for the patient, and personality needed for being a good nurse.”

The nominator’s name is withheld to protect their privacy.

Pardy has accepted a job at a Carle Health facility in the orthopedics surgical unit.

A committee at KCC chose Pardy for the award, which presented on July 25 at KCC’s LPN pinning ceremony. She received a certificate, a DAISY Award pin and a sculpture called *A Healer’s Touch*, hand-carved by artists of the Shona Tribe in Zimbabwe.

KCC’s practical nursing program has a competitive entry process, and accepts new students each fall semester. It incorporates classroom lectures, clinical experiences and lab demonstrations. The program is designed to prepare students for work in hospital departments, as well as in long-term care, home care, business and industry, outpatient clinics, public agencies, and physicians’ offices. LPNs also can apply for advanced placement into KCC’s registered nursing program.

For information about entry requirements, consult with a KCC advisor or contact the program director, Jennifer Rogers at [jrogers@kcc.edu](mailto:jrogers@kcc.edu) or phone 815-802-8828.

**About The DAISY Foundation**

The DAISY Foundation is a not-for-profit organization, established in memory of J. Patrick Barnes, by members of his family. Patrick died at the age of 33 in late 1999 from complications of Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP), a little known but not uncommon auto-immune disease. (DAISY is an acronym for Diseases Attacking the Immune System.) The care Patrick and his family received from Nurses while he was ill inspired the creation of The DAISY Award for Extraordinary Nurses, an evidenced-based means of providing nurse recognition and thanking nurses for making a profound difference in the lives of their patients and patient families.
