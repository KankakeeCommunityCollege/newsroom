The KCC Student Nurses Association organization is hosting a fundraising event for the Manteno Veteran’s home until Nov 8.

For the “No Tricks, Just Treats” drive, the club is collecting individually wrapped snacks and treats that will be delivered on Veteran’s Day.

The collection box is in KCC’s Health Careers Division Office, Room W102. Here are requests from the veterans:

* Individually packaged cookies
* Microwave popcorn-regular & flavored
* Single serve bags of chips
* Bite size candy bars
* Snack cakes (Little Debbie / Hostess)
* Tootsie Pop suckers
* Microwavable cups of soup
* Hormel complete meals
* Microwave mac & cheese
* Chicken/tuna salad with crackers

Thank you for supporting our heroes!
