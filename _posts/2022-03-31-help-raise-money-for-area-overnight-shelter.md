Phi Theta Kappa is raising money for [Fortitude Community Outreach](https://fortitudecommunityoutreach.org/){: target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' }, which provides overnight shelter for homeless people. 

Fortitude is planning to build a permanent shelter in Kankakee. [Phi Theta Kappa](https://www.kcc.edu/student-resources/clubs/#phi-theta-kappa)’s goal is to raise $500 for Fortitude by the end of the spring semester. One of PTK’s fund-raisers is selling Fannie May candy bars. Candy bars are $2 each (Cash only). PTK members will be selling candy bars in the College Center on Monday, April 4 from noon - 1 p.m. 

Candy bars can also be purchased from Professor Frances Hebert in her office, Room L349, during these hours or anytime her office door is open: 

- Monday & Wednesday – 10:30 a.m. - noon; 1:45-3:45 p.m.
- Tuesday – 12:30-1 p.m. 

Phi Theta Kappa is an [international academic honor society](https://www.ptk.org/){: target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' } for community college students. The KCC chapter, Alpha Delta Eta has achieved Five Star status—for the highest level of activity—in six of the last seven years.
