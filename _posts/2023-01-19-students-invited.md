If you would like to lead assigned projects, serve as an active member of KCCâ€™s Student Advisory Council and take part in various college events and ceremonies: this is the opportunity for you. Additionally, the trustee will receive a $1500 scholarship courtesy of the KCC Foundation.

"Students in this prestigious position have an advantage when competing for scholarships and employment opportunities," said Maurice Sullivan, KCC coordinator of student life.
