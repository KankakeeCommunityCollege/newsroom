We are fortunate to have him as one of our long-time leaders and we appreciate his many years of civic service.”<br><br>Hoekstra, of St. Anne, joined the KCC board of trustees on Dec. 12, 1991. He is the longest-serving current member of the board. During his tenure, Hoekstra has served as the board’s vice chair from November 1995 to January 2014; and as board chair from January 2014 to December 2018.<br><br>“Thirty years ago, I was asked by Fey Orr if I would consider taking his place on the KCC Board of Trustees when he retired,” said Hoekstra. “I felt both humbled and challenged. &nbsp;My time on the board has been very fulfilling. &nbsp;KCC has been blessed with many great board members who worked together for the success of the college. &nbsp;I am just happy that I could be part of it\!”<br><br>“Trustee Hoekstra has made such a substantial impact here at Kankakee Community College,” said KCC President Dr. Michael Boyd. “For 30 years, he’s been generous with his time, his energy, and his wisdom. &nbsp;His motivation has always been enhancing student success because he understands the role that KCC’s graduates play in empowering economic development in the communities this college serves. &nbsp;Jerry’s guidance as a trustee has been so helpful for me, personally. &nbsp;He takes a genuine interest in everyone’s success and provides gentle but meaningful mentoring and advice.”
