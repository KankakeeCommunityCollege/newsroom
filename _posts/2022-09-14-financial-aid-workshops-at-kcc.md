Each workshop includes how to fill out the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid), the form used at all two- and four-year colleges and universities to determine eligibility for federal and state grants, work-study programs, subsidized and unsubsidized student loans and some scholarships. On Oct. 4, there will also be information about KCC scholarships.

All sessions are provided as a public service and are open to students and parents regardless of the college they plan to attend.

The FAFSA becomes available Oct. 1. Students [can apply for 2023-24 scholarships](https://foundation.kcc.edu/scholarships/) at KCC from Oct. 1, 2022 - May 1, 2023.

“We recommend that all prospective students complete the FAFSA as soon as possible, even if you are still deciding on a school,” said Megan Ponton, KCC assistant director of financial aid. “Your financial aid package starts with submitting your FAFSA, and we are here to help guide you through this process.”

To fill out a FAFSA, participants need completed 2021 tax returns and W-2 forms, plus an FSA ID, username and password for both the student and parent. Go to&nbsp;[studentaid.gov/fsa-id](https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/sign-in/landing)&nbsp;to create an account and get FSA IDs.
