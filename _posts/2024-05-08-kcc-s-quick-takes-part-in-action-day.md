As she completes the registered nursing program at KCC, Sarah Quick is also nearing the end of her tenure as president of the Illinois Student Nurses Association.

Quick recently took part in one of her final activities with SNA.

"What an unforgettable Student Nurse Political Action Day," Quick said regarding the April 16 event, held in Springfield. "From the heartwarming stories to the powerful advocacy, not only from amazing nurses, but also amazing student nurses!

"We had an amazing day with (people from) many colleges and universities from around Illinois that drove hours to come. We had a amazing speaker."

The keynote speaker was Marcus D. Henderson, a registered nurse and doctoral candidate at the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing.

Quick, of Kankakee, will take part in the Registered Nursing pinning ceremony Friday, May 10 at KCC. She also will graduate from KCC during the college's commencement ceremony on Saturday, May 11.

Quick has accepted a position as a registered nurse at the Illinois Veterans Home Manteno. She also will continue her education to complete a bachelor’s degree in nursing.

With the Illinois Student Nurses Association, Quick remains as president until the state convention in September. At that time, a new SNA board will be elected.

KCC’s two-year registered nursing program has a competitive entry process, and accepts new students each fall and spring semester. It incorporates classroom lectures, clinical experiences and lab demonstrations. The program is designed to prepare students for work in hospital departments, as well as in long-term care, home care, business and industry, outpatient clinics, public agencies, and physicians’ offices.

For information about entry requirements, consult with a KCC advisor or contact the program director, Jenny Rogers at [jrogers@kcc.edu](mailto:jrogers@kcc.edu){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or phone 815-802-8828.
