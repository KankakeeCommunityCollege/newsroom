Horton Jr., died Tuesday, Nov. 8 at the age of 90.

Horton became KCC president on Jan. 1, 1977. During his tenure, KCC’s credit enrollment increased by more than 50%, and the continuing education enrollment increased more than 160%. The college also became the local administrator of the Comprehensive Employment Training Act, predecessor of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. During Horton’s presidency, the college expanded program offerings, paid off its mortgage, and established an art collection after obtaining an Illinois Arts Council grant for KCC.

Horton worked with the KCC board of trustees to bring about several building renovations that improved the learning and teaching environment for students and faculty, and the college’s first activities/athletics building was constructed during his tenure.&nbsp;

&nbsp;Horton also worked with the University of Illinois Landscape Architecture![Former KCC president Dr. Lilburn H.

In addition to beautification of the college, a “prairie acre” of native Illinois vegetation was developed on the west side of the campus. This area was dedicated as the “L.H. Horton, Jr. Prairie Acre” at the time of his retirement from KCC in 1987.&nbsp;

“It was my pleasure to have worked with Dr. Horton at Western Illinois University, the Illinois Community College Trustees Association, and finally for 10 years at KCC,” said Dr. Larry Huffman, who became KCC’s president immediately after Horton. “He was one of the brightest people I've ever known, and I was fortunately able to learn a lot from him over the years.”

In a September 1978 profile for the KCC student newspaper, Horton said his main job as president was to “provide quality education opportunities to everyone in the college district.” He also said “I feel KCC has one of the better programs in the state, and that students who transfer to senior institutions do better than those entering as freshmen.”

In a June 17, 1987 interview with Dr. James Paul, retired KCC professor, Horton discussed his years at KCC.

“We tried to really work on all aspects of the campus environment to make it a better place to work, a place that students and staff could be proud of, and a place that you would want to attend,” he said. Horton also said he tried to make KCC into “one of the best small public community colleges anyplace. I think this is a school of integrity and academic quality and one of beauty.”

“(Horton) stewarded the initial funds the college has used to acquire and maintain an art collection,” said Dr. Michael Boyd, KCC’s current president. “It was Burnie's vision to develop on-campus athletic facilities so that KCC's teams could play home games on campus.”

Horton left KCC at the end of June 1987, to become superintendent/president at San Joaquin Delta Community College in California. At the time of his death, Horton resided in Stanwood, Washington, near Seattle.

His wife, Elizabeth, passed away in November 2019. Horton has two sons, David and Lilburn (Lee) III; a daughter, Genevieve (Merrill); as well as five grandchildren and one great-grandchild.

After KCC, he became superintendent/president, at San Joaquin Delta Community College in California from 1987-1999. He is the longest-serving president in that college’s history.

Horton was born on May 1, 1932 in Haysi, Virginia. He had two bachelor’s degrees from the University of Cincinnati, in 1954 and 1955. Horton then completed a master’s degree from Fort Hays State University in 1960. In 1970, he completed a doctorate in higher education from Indiana University.

Before coming to KCC as its third full-time president, Horton was executive director of the Illinois Community College Trustees Association. He also worked at Western Illinois University in Macomb, Fort Hays State University in Kansas, Washington State University, and at a junior high in Cincinnati.

The Horton family has requested that memorial donations in Horton’s name may be directed to the student scholarship fund of the Kankakee Community College Foundation, 100 College Drive, Kankakee, IL 60901; or the Delta College Foundation, 5151 Pacific Avenue, Stockton, CA 95207.

As requested by Horton, there will not be a funeral or other services.

Dr. Lilburn H. Horton, Jr. (“Burnie” to his family, friends, and professional colleagues) passed away on November 8, 2022, shortly after entering Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Washington.&nbsp;

He was born on May 1, 1932 in Haysi, Virginia to Lilburn H. Horton, Sr. and Gladys (Collie) Horton.&nbsp; Burnie’s parents soon moved to Oak Park, Illinois, where he attended public schools, and as the oldest of 5 children undertook the responsibility after his father was drafted into the military of helping his mother care for his siblings.

After earning a bachelor’s degree from the University of Cincinnati, Burnie took a job in the Wilson Compton Union at Washington State University, where he met a WSU student, Elizabeth Gildow, who became his wife of 63 years until her passing exactly 3 years to the day before Burnie’s death.&nbsp; Burnie and Beth had 3 children, L.H. Horton III (Belinda) of Naples, Florida, Genevieve (Greg) Merrill of Laverne, California, and David (Diane) Horton of Fort Myers, Florida.

In addition to Burnie’s children, he is survived by grandchildren Nicole, Genevieve, and Alexander Horton, Ryan and Haley Merrill, and brothers Charles Horton and Michael Horton. He was preceded in death by his wife, his parents, sister Ruth Barker and brother James Horton.

Burnie left Washington State University for a position at Fort Hays State College in Kansas, where he also earned a master’s degree, and then moved to Macomb, Illinois to be the Director of the University Union Building and Associate Vice President for Student Activities at Western Illinois University.&nbsp; While at WIU, Burnie completed the requirements for an Ed.D. degree in Higher Education at Indiana University.&nbsp; The Horton family moved to Springfield, Illinois in the early 1970s when Burnie took the position of Executive Director of the Illinois Community College Trustees Association.&nbsp;

Burnie was hired as President of Kankakee Community College (Kankakee, Illinois) in January, 1977 and served in that capacity until June, 1987.&nbsp; During that decade, he sought collaboration with a University of Illinois Landscape Architecture group to develop a comprehensive plan for landscaping and tree planting, the result of which was the KCC campus becoming one of the most beautiful campuses in the state. &nbsp;As part of this comprehensive plan, a “prairie acre” of native Illinois vegetation was developed on the west side of the campus, and that became dedicated as the “L.H. Horton, Jr. Prairie Acre” at the time of his retirement from KCC in 1987. &nbsp;Burnie worked with the KCC board of trustees to bring about several building renovations that improved the learning and teaching environment for students and faculty, and the college’s first activities/athletics building was constructed during his tenure.&nbsp; Burnie also obtained an Illinois Arts Council grant for KCC, which enabled the acquisition of Illinois artists’ paintings to grace the halls, classrooms, and offices, as well as financed purchases of some exterior sculptures for the campus grounds.

Since he was still an energetic person committed to higher education pursuits when he retired from KCC, Burnie applied for the presidency at San Joaquin Delta College in Stockton, California and was hired there, where he served from 1987 to 1999.&nbsp; Among his accomplishments at Delta College were restoring of the campus infrastructure, constructing a child development center, increasing state-of-the-art technology, advancing educational opportunities for minority students, and raising the quality of faculty and staff.&nbsp; Continuing one of his keen personal interests, he advanced Delta’s focus on the visual arts through acquisition of art works and development of the college’s art gallery, which is now known as the “L.H. Horton, Jr. Art Gallery.”&nbsp;

Burnie retired (for good this time) in 1999, and he and Beth spent their retirement years near Stanwood, Washington, enjoying picturesque sunset views and peaceful strolls along Warm Beach. With their eyes admiring the beauty of nature that surrounded them, Burnie and Beth became even more aware of the importance of protecting the environment. &nbsp;

During his working days, Burnie took pride in bringing out the best in people and empowering them to lead.&nbsp; Always foremost in his mind was doing what was best for students and for the colleges he served with honor and distinction.&nbsp;

He treasured many friends, especially his good friend since his grade school days, Ed Eckhart, and his longtime colleague in higher education administration, Larry Huffman.&nbsp;

Burnie had many personal interests and particularly loved collecting, including original Audubon prints, art lithographs, coins, stamps, postcards, and historic ephemera.&nbsp; He also enjoyed watching sports and listening to his type of music, with classical or opera music commonly being heard in the Horton home when Burnie was home.

Those who knew Burnie Horton well are probably considering that he may already have developed an environmentally-friendly cloud project or a halo-recycling program in his new heavenly home—with helpful suggestions from Beth, of course.&nbsp; He is likely making sure the Pearly Gates are looking better than ever, too.

An agreement had been made in advance with the Neptune Society Cremation Plan for Dr. Horton’s final arrangements, and as he requested, there will be no funeral or other services.&nbsp; In lieu of flowers, memorial donations in Burnie’s name may be directed to the student scholarship fund of the Kankakee Community College Foundation, 100 College Drive, Kankakee, IL 60901 or the Delta College Foundation, 5151 Pacific Avenue, Stockton, CA 95207.
