Everyone who visits KCC (faculty, staff and students) are reminded that masks are required, and should be worn properly.

Masks should cover your nose and mouth and fit snugly to your face. If you need a few tips, please check out[these CDC guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
