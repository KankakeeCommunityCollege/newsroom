Some good news: the west elevator, which was undergoing repairs, is now fully operational again. Students and staff can use it again.

Before being re-opened for public use, the&nbsp; elevator successfully passed an operation inspection conducted by the state fire marshall.

We appreciate everyone's patience and understanding while the elevator was being updated.
