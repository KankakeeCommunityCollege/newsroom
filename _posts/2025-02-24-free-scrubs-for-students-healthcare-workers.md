“Not all superheroes wear capes, some of them wear scrubs.” Filson Thomas

Attention Health Careers Students!

Are you in need of scrubs? For those of you currently working in healthcare or who will be graduating in May and entering the health care field, there will be a section with scrubs at the Cavaliers Closet March 3, 4 and 5 in the Cavalier Room.

Scrubs, along with regular clothing, will be available to KCC students at no cost.

We look forward to seeing you there!
