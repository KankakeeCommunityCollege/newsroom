The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention invites community members to come together for the Walk Out of Darkness on Saturday, October 4, at 1 p.m.

The walk will take place on the Kankakee Community College campus and is an opportunity to raise awareness, honor those we’ve lost, support those affected, and help fund vital suicide prevention programs.

Your participation—whether by walking, donating, or spreading the word—helps bring hope and healing to individuals, families, and our entire community.
