On Tuesday, May 13, 2025, a group of 15 police officers from the Kankakee County Special Response Team will be on KCC's Riverfront Campus for a facilities tour. They will be accompanied by Eric Springer, KCC chief of police.

The officers are touring the campus to stay familiar with its layout, as several changes have occurred over the past few years. The visit is part of their ongoing preparedness efforts to ensure they can respond effectively in the event of an emergency.

Please extend a warm welcome if you see them.
