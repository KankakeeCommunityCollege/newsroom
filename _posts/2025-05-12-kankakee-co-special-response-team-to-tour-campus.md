Tomorrow, May 13, 15 police officers from the Kankakee County Special Response Team will be on campus for a facilities tour. They will be accompanied by Eric Springer, our Chief of Police.

The officers are touring the campus to stay familiar with the layout, as several changes have occurred over the past few years. This visit is part of their ongoing preparedness efforts to ensure they can respond effectively in the event of an emergency.

Please extend a warm welcome if you see them on campus!
