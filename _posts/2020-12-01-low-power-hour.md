KCC will conduct a "one hour power curtailment test" on Thursday June 24, from 1-2 on the Riverfront Campus.

This test is to show the college is able to reduce energy consumption to meet a goal designated by it's energy supplier.

Those at KCC's Riverfront Campus may find lights and other electric items will be turned off as long as they do not disrupt teaching or regular business operations.
