The KCC Miner Memorial Library is being renovated over the next 10 months to become a new Student Success Center and Library.

All library resources will still be available—just in different locations—during the renovation.

**Beginning Dec. 2:&nbsp;**Find most services in Room D212. Some materials will be available in Room D212, and the rest are stored elsewhere and available upon request.![](/uploads/rendering2.jpg){: .float-image-left width="390" height="249"}

The Student Success Center (including the library, tutoring services, and Instructional Technology & Faculty Development) is scheduled to open for Fall 2020.
