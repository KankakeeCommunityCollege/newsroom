A Student Success Mentoring Program designed to empower students through meaningful mentorship connections is starting at KCC.

The first group of mentors and students will be paired for the Fall 2025 semester.

“This program is more than just guidance, it’s about building relationships that inspire students to persist, thrive, and graduate,” said Melany Villagomez, KCC’s coordinator of equity, diversity and inclusion. “Through regular engagement, mentors will help students strengthen their academic skills, develop leadership potential, boost self-esteem, and grow as individuals.

“Research shows that students with mentors are more likely to stay in school, perform better academically, and feel a stronger sense of belonging,” Villagomez continued. “At KCC, we believe that every student deserves a champion, and this program is hoping to make that happen.”

Members of the community, KCC alumns, faculty and staff are all invited to become mentors.

“Whether you’re a seasoned professional, a proud alum, or a passionate community member, your experience and encouragement can be the spark that helps a student succeed.,” Villagomez said.

The process is:

1. Fill out the Mentor Interest Form -- accessible by QR code on the flyer and at [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1MCPaGxBFUKUum9dy7VKU3fJF-wKLdPbGepwMwF5Mn88/viewform?edit\_requested=true](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1MCPaGxBFUKUum9dy7VKU3fJF-wKLdPbGepwMwF5Mn88/viewform?edit_requested=true "KCC Mentor Interest Form"){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Responses on the interest form will help the college match mentors with students.
