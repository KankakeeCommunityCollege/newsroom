In this role, Whitelow will oversee KCC’s customized training and continuing education area, which serve business, industry, public service and community members. She will also work directly with local employers to build partnerships which strengthen the skills of both current and potential employees.

Whitelow has a bachelor’s degree in physical anthropology and a master’s degree in education with a concentration in workforce education and development, both from Southern Illinois University at Carbondale. In 2024, she earned a doctorate in educational leadership from Chicago State University.

Her administrative background includes roles at Southern Illinois University; Chicago State University College of Education; and Governors State University, office of the vice president of Administration and Finance.

Each year, about 1,500 people complete non-credit workforce training and professional development at KCC. While these seminars and workshops do not offer college credit, many—including those in health care, social services, and education—qualify for continuing education or professional development units. Other programs lead to industry-recognized credentials, such as CPR Healthcare Provider and Food Safety Manager Certification.
