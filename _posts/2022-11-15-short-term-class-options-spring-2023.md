For the spring 2023 semester, Kankakee Community College will offer a range of short-term classes – including six transferrable classes that are just four weeks long.&nbsp;

"The addition of four-week classes in Liberal Arts and Sciences will allow students to design schedules that respect their life-school balance," said Jennifer Hays Huggins, KCC's dean of Liberal Arts and Sciences. "Taking one class every four weeks in the 16-week semester equates to full-time enrollment, which gets students that much closer to reaching their academic goals, particularly students who only had the time previously to attend part-time."
