“We are proud to serve veterans, and to be designated as a Military Friendly® School,” said Megan Ponton, assistant director of financial aid at KCC. “The college is dedicated to supporting veterans and active-duty military personnel, alongside their families, in their transition to higher education. We facilitate access to federal and state VA educational benefits and financial aid. We also provide comprehensive assistance tailored to individual academic, professional, and personal aspirations.”

Throughout Illinois, there are only 13 community colleges which achieved a Military Friendly® designation this year. Community colleges were categorized as “small” or “large.” A total of 232 community colleges earned the Military Friendly designation.

KCC is also a Military Spouse Friendly School.

“Military Friendly is committed to transparency and providing consistent data-driven standards in our designation process,” said Kayla Lopez, national director of military partnerships for Military Friendly. “Our standards provide a benchmark that promotes positive outcomes and support services that better the educational landscape and provide opportunity for the Military Community. This creates a competitive atmosphere that encourages Institutions to evolve and invest in their programs consistently. Schools who achieve awards designation show true commitment in their efforts, going over and above that standard.”

According to Military Friendly, methodology, criteria, and weightings were determined by Viqtory with input from the Military Friendly Advisory Council of independent leaders in the higher education and military recruitment community. Final ratings combined the institution’s survey scores with the assessment of the institution’s ability to meet thresholds for student retention, graduation, job placement, loan repayment, degree advancement or transfer, and loan default rates for all students and, specifically, for student veterans.

The 2025-26 Military Friendly® Schools list will be published in the May and October issue of G.I. Jobs magazine and can be found at [MilitaryFriendly.com/schools](http://www.militaryfriendly.com/schools/).
