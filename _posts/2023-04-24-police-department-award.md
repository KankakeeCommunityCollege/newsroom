To earn [Lexipol Connect gold-level recognition](https://www.lexipol.com/connect-recognition-program/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, the KCC department submitted its policies, which were reviewed by Lexipol to assure performance met targeted levels. The evaluation included policies such as elements of arrest, civil rights, and how legal updates are reviewed. The review also included criteria for daily training bulletins, which each officer completed successfully during the review period of Jan. 1 to Dec. 31, 2022.

“Our officers work hard, and they work well together to keep the college safe,” said KCC’s Police Chief, Eric Springer. Springer noted that when there is a new law, new policy, or policy change, Lexipol sends the change to him for review before making any changes.

“This is a measure of the quality of officers that we have,” said KCC Police Lt. Michael Stoltz.

KCC's Police department have received the award for two consecutive years.

KCC formed a sworn police department in 2012. The department currently has three full-time officers and eight part-time officers. The college also employs a total of six public safety officers.
