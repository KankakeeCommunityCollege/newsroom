Kankakee Community College will share information on how to become an adjunct instructor during a virtual information session Wednesday, May 21 at 5 p.m.

Adjunct instructors are part-time faculty members who teaches college courses on a contractual basis.

“Being an adjunct instructor offers a unique opportunity to share your expertise while making a direct impact on students’ lives,” said Dr. Quincy Rose Sewell, KCC’s vice president for academic affairs. “It’s a meaningful and rewarding way to stay connected to your profession while helping learners grow and achieve their goals.”

The session will use Zoom. It is open to the public at [bit.ly/KCCadjunct525](){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. No reservation is required.

Topics will include what is involved in being an adjunct instructor, how to be considered for a position, and tips for submitting the application. Participants will be able to speak with KCC’s academic deans about current openings.

KCC pays adjunct instructors $872 per credit hour. Additionally a variety of support and instructional resources are available. Qualifications vary by subject area. For transfer-level courses, instructors must have a master’s degree in the appropriate discipline, or a related field. For career and technical education courses, a bachelor’s degree or relevant work experience in the field is typically required.
