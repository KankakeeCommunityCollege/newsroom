Anyone can come take in the beautiful scenery at KCC and enjoy a delicious lunch or snack. Menu items can be purchased while supplies last.

KCC is located at 100 College Drive in Kankakee. Find the Food Truck at the East Pavilion, near the KCC Baseball field. Picnic tables are available nearby, and the area offers a nice view of KCC's north lawn and the Kankakee River.

In May and June, five visits are planned so far:

* [Monster Grilled Cheese Food Truck](https://www.facebook.com/people/Monster-Grilled-Cheese-More/100063684804715/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}\: May 19 & May 26; 11 a.m. - 2 p.m.
* [Que It Up BBQ](https://www.facebook.com/QueItUpCafe){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}\: May 24, June 2 & June 9;&nbsp; 11 a.m. - 2 p.m.

Additional dates and vendors might be added. All Food Trucks visit dates, times and vendor names are in the [KCC events calendar](https://news.kcc.edu/events/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Look for events with the Food Truck graphic.
