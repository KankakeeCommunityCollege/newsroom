The [Health Careers Applications process](https://kcc.smartcatalogiq.com/current/Academic-Catalog/Programs-of-Study-by-Area/Health-Careers/Health-Careers-Requirements/Application-Process){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} begins with admission to KCC.

Each program has an eligibility worksheet included in the application information.

Prospective students also meet with a KCC health careers adviser and take the HESI A2 exam.
