KCC Student Life has teamed up with local community organizations to help you connect, serve, and grow through volunteer opportunities!

We’re excited to introduce the **Community Connections** page on the **Student Life webpage** — your go-to resource for finding volunteer opportunities in our area. Whether you’re passionate about helping kids, supporting the environment, or giving back in other meaningful ways, there’s something for everyone. The page is actively updated as we make more connections with community organizations.

On the Community Connections page, you’ll find:

* A list of local organizations actively seeking volunteers
* Contact information and details about each opportunity
* Everything you need to get started and schedule your service

Volunteering is a great way to build your resume, explore career interests, meet new people, and make a lasting impact — all while giving back to the community that supports us.

Check out the [**Community Connections**](https://www.kcc.edu/student-resources/student-life/community-connections/) page today and find your perfect volunteer match! Visit the [**KCC Student Life webpage**](https://www.kcc.edu/student-resources/student-life/community-connections/) to get started.
