KCC Student Life has teamed up with local community organizations to help KCC’s students connect, serve, and grow through volunteer opportunities!

The [**Community Connections**](https://www.kcc.edu/student-resources/student-life/community-connections/ "Community Connections"){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} page on the [**Student Life webpage**](https://www.kcc.edu/student-resources/student-life/ "Student Life page"){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} — is a good resource for finding volunteer opportunities in our area. Whether you’re passionate about helping kids, supporting the environment, or giving back in other meaningful ways, there’s something for everyone.

“The page is actively updated as we make more connections with community organizations,” said Maurice Sullivan, coordinator of student life at KCC.

The Community Connections page offers:

* A list of local organizations actively seeking volunteers
* Contact information and details about each opportunity
* Everything you need to get started and schedule your service

“Volunteering is a great way to build your resume, explore career interests, meet new people, and make a lasting impact — all while giving back to the community that supports us,” Sullivan said.
