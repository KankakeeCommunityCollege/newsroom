Some online services - including Self-Service - will not be available from 5 p.m. on Thursday, Sept. 30 - 11:59 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 3.

Self-service includes:

* Statements and bill payment.
* Searching for courses, class schedules and registration.
* Viewing grades.
* Your personal financial aid information ([www.kcc.edu/financialaid](http://www.kcc.edu/financialaid) will still be active).

This downtime will enable the college to migrate existing data to new servers.

For the most part, [www.kcc.edu](https://www.kcc.edu) will still be operational. Only web pages connected to the system being migrated will be affected. Also not affected: [Canvas](https://kcc.instructure.com/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and the [KCC Catalog](https://kcc.smartcatalogiq.com/current/Academic-Catalog){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

We apologize for any inconvenience.
