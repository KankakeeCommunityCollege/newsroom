On Dec. 2, KCC hosted a packing party for the Police Care Package Project in the Iroquois Room and had a fantastic turnout! Thanks to the efforts of many volunteers, 450 boxes were packed with gifts for every police officer in Kankakee County.

Thank you to the KCC Veterans Association, Criminal Justice Club and Project Headspace & Timing for making this project happen!
