Fulton Distinguished Alumni Award video"){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, including awards such as Hometown Hero, Nonprofit of the Year, Young Citizen of the Year, and more. As a veteran, Peterson faced personal challenges, including PTSD and substance abuse. Instead of succumbing to despair, he founded Project Headspace and Timing. This 501(c)(3) nonprofit promotes positive mental health practices to U.S. military veterans by working to unify them with their communities, nature, and themselves. The organization’s impactful initiatives, such as the Spartan Shield Veteran Advocacy Program and Troops on Trails, highlight Peterson's commitment to positive engagement and mental health practices for veterans. Despite facing personal obstacles, including the suicide of a teammate and death of his mother, Peterson remains dedicated to advocating for veterans, emphasizing the importance of mental health awareness and community support. His journey of self-discovery has not only transformed his life but also illuminated the struggles faced by veterans.
