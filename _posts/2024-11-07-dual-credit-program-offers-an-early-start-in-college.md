The community colleges of Illinois are leading providers of dual credit, which provides high school students the opportunity to earn credits toward their diploma and college degree while in high school.

Through dual credit, Illinois community colleges increase access to higher education by preparing high school students for college level coursework. Dual credit also lowers college costs by shortening the time it takes to complete a college degree.

“By the time I get done taking dual credit courses while in high school, I should have 18 college credit hours that will transfer to my four-year institution,” said Abby Purcell of Manteno, a senior at Bishop McNamara High School. Purcell has completed three dual credit courses. She is currently enrolled in two, and she plans to enroll in one more during her final semester.

“This is equivalent to one college semester that I don’t have to pay for at the four-year college tuition rate and will provide me with flexibility in my college-level schedule potentially allowing me to take courses I need for my major earlier,” she said.

All 48 Illinois community colleges offer dual credit courses.

Dual credit “allows a student get gain exposure to the academic demands of college-level courses, better preparing them for the rigors of college,” Purcell said.

Following are local and statewide statistics from Fiscal Year 2023 showing student participation in dual credit opportunities.

* Illinois community colleges offered a total of 14,638 dual credit courses.
* More than 82,600 high school students enrolled in one or more community college dual credit courses during that time.
* [High school students who take dual credit courses have substantially higher community college graduation rates and advancement rates than those students who did not enroll in dual credit coursework.]()
* Through the dual credit program, KCC has estimated to save students more than $548,000 of tuition in Fiscal Year 2023.
* KCC had 656 dual credit students from August 2022 to June 2023. They completed 3,754 credits. Of them, more than 150 students earned seven or more college credits.
* The five areas with the most dual credit earned by KCC-area students (number of students shown in parenthesis) were Automotive Technology (154), Welding Technology (94), Nursing Assistant (94), Health information/Medical Records Technology (46) and Child Care Provider (20).

In addition to Dual Credit, KCC also offers high school students opportunities to earn college credit in the Early College Program, through Dual Enrollment, and through appropriate scores on Advanced Placement exams.

According to KCC information, some of the programs are not offered at all schools. Participating students must meet their school’s criteria for participating and receiving college credit. In addition, there might also be an application, documentation requirement and/or test fees depending on the program and the school’s policies.
