![](/uploads/2023/child-sleeping-in-bed-200x250.jpg){: .float-image-right width="200" height="250"}The KCC Student Nurses Association is collecting twin-sized sheets to donate to local children who need them.

* The sheets should be new.
* They will be given to [Sleep in Heavenly Peace](https://shpbeds.org/chapter/il-kankakee-area/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for their next event where they build beds for area kids.

To donate, bring new twin-size sheets to the donation barrel near Room M118 in the Health Careers Hallway. The final day for donations is Feb. 29.
