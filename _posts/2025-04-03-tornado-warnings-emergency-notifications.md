As we enter storm season, it's important to remember KCC emergency procedures in the event of a tornado warning.

Students and employees should be familiar with designated tornado shelter locations. They are on the Police & Safety website, [Emergency Notifications](https://www.kcc.edu/about/police-and-safety/#notifications) section.

When there is a tornado warning:

* A notification will be broadcast through the speakers on the campus phone system.
* Seek shelter in the nearest interior room on the first floor, away from windows and doors. Tornado shelter locations are marked.
* Wait for further instructions. Updates will be provided as needed.
* Do not leave shelter areas until an official announcement states it is safe to do so.

If you have any questions, please contact Public Safety/Police at 815-802-8190.
