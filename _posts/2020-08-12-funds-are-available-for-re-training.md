Recently, I have been receiving emails and phone calls from manufacturers as far north as Cook County looking for trained welders and maintenance technicians. The number of manufacturing jobs available outnumber the qualified applicants. Now is a wonderful time to get trained to add to your resume or move up within your company.”<br><br>A [2018 study](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/manufacturing/articles/future-of-manufacturing-skills-gap-study.html){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} by one of the world’s largest accounting and professional services organizations, Deloitte, showed that 2.4 million manufacturing positions could be unfilled by 2028.
