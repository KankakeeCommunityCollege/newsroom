The event begins with lunch at 11 a.m. and a shotgun start at noon. It includes lunch; 18 holes of golf; cart; on-course beverages; and prizes and games on the course.

“The outing is one way for former athletes and community members to continue supporting the program,” said Bryce Shafer, KCC’s athletic director. “We’re going to get together for a good time. It’s a great chance to network and support the Cavaliers.”

The fee is $100 per golfer. Sponsorships are also available. All proceeds support KCC Cavaliers athletics.

KCC has seven intercollegiate sports – baseball, men’s and women’s basketball, men’s and women’s soccer, softball and volleyball.

During the Spring 2024 semester, 67 KCC athletes achieved a 3.0 or higher GPA. Thirteen of them had perfect 4.0 GPAs. In 2024 the volleyball, softball, baseball and women’s soccer teams all received NJCAA Academic Team Awards by having above 3.0 GPA for the academic year.

This fall, 31 recent Cavaliers have transferred to continue their athletic and academic careers at NCAA and NAIA colleges and universities, including Central Michigan University, Culver Stockton College, Governors State University, Millikin University, Olivet Nazarene University and Southern Illinois University–Carbondale.

“I’m proud of the achievements of our athletes and the coaches who lead them,” Shafer said. “The teams work hard both on the field and in the classroom. It pays dividends for years to come. Community support really helps with things like tutoring help and quality equipment.”
