Sophomore Peyton Niksch threw the Cavaliers’ second ever perfect game on Sunday, March 2.

In 7 innings, Niksch struck out 16 Olney Central College batters. The only other perfect game for KCC was Coltan Carr in 2017 vs. Queensborough Community College.

Accolades have followed:

* Niksch was named NJCAA national Pitcher of the Week on March 5
* High praise from [The JBB](https://thejbb.substack.com/p/the-jbb-week-6-honors-pres-by-flatground "The JBB"){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, Junior College Baseball blog: “Peyton Niksch (Kankakee) (Purdue Commit) - Niksch authored a perfect game masterpiece: 7 IP, 0 H, 0 BB, 16 Ks. His 16 strikeouts in a flawless outing is the stuff of legend, leaving hitters utterly helpless.”
* Recognition from Mountain Dew Park, in Marion, where the game occurred. It was the first perfect game at the college-level or higher at the stadium.
