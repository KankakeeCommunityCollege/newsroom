This is a message emailed this morning to students from KCC's vice president for student affairs.

Dear Students:

The college is closely observing developments of the coronavirus (COVID 19) outbreak, both locally and nationally. We are watching information from the&nbsp;[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;(CDC) and the&nbsp;[Illinois Department of Public Health](http://www.dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/diseases-and-conditions/diseases-a-z-list/coronavirus){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;for updates and official information. As we are sure you understand, the outbreak and its consequences are continuously changing.

At this time, we do not know of any coronavirus cases within the KCC community. The ability of the college to maintain a healthy environment is a partnership among our faculty, staff, students and visitors. It remains very important to continue common-sense precautions and actions as defenses against coronavirus and other viruses and respiratory illnesses, including the flu:

* Stay home if you’re sick;
* Avoid close contact with people who are sick;
* Cover coughs and sneezes;
* Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces;
* Wash your hands often with soap and water, for at least 20 seconds—an alcohol-based hand sanitizer can be used when soap and water are not available; and
* Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.

Additionally, if you are returning from China, Iran, Italy, Japan, or South Korea—countries with an&nbsp;[alert level of 2 or 3](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;designated by the CDC—please self-monitor for coughing, difficulty breathing and fever by taking your temperature twice per day for at least 14 days. During that time, you should stay home and limit interactions with others as much as possible. If you traveled to a country with a widespread coronavirus outbreak (again, level 2 or 3 designated by the CDC), the college can accommodate options to study from home for two-weeks (until March 27) upon request. Email me at&nbsp;[jdasilva@kcc.edu](mailto:jdasilva@kcc.edu)&nbsp;to learn more.

Thank you for your diligence and care.

Sincerely,

Dr. Jose da Silva<br>Vice President for Student Affairs
