Yesterday (June 19), KCC called a licensed exterminator to investigate a report of bed bugs in the Miner Memorial Library. The bugs were found in one couch in the library.

Other areas of the library, a nearby hallway, and the Child Development Center were also inspected. No more bugs were found.

The affected area was treated—and a number of other locations were treated as a precaution. The couch and several other pieces of nearby furniture have been bagged and removed.

The exterminator will return to check the area in about two weeks.

The library will re-open on Monday, June 24.

Anyone with questions regarding KCC’s response efforts can contact [Brian Yeoman](byeoman@kcc.edu), assistant director of Physical Plant Operations; or [Rob Kenney](mailto:rkenney@kcc.edu), coordinator of Facility Construction & Building Maintenance.

Detailed information on bed bugs and appropriate control measures can be obtained on the [Illinois Department of Public Health](http://www.dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/environmental-health-protection/structural-pest-control/bed-bugs#resources) and [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov/managing-pests-schools/bed-bugs-and-schools#steps) web sites.
