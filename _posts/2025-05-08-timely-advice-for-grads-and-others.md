KCC would like to share this free resource guide with the community: [Great Advice for Grads 2025](https://publications.inceptia.org/view/488390547/6/). It’s a flip-book created by [Inceptia](https://www.inceptia.org/) and [Nerdwallet](https://www.nerdwallet.com/).

Inceptia is a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving access to and success in higher education by providing solutions for student financial aid, verification, and loan repayment. NerdWallet is a financial services company and website that provides free financial advice, tools, and content to help consumers make informed financial decisions.

Inceptia provides the following services for KCC:

* **Grace Counseling Outreach** - Grace Counseling Outreach is a preventative service that helps identify and solve potential issues before they become problems. Our highly trained counselors reach out to student borrowers (up to three attempts) who have become enrolled less than half time to inform them while still in their grace period what to expect when repayment begins, and what resources may be available if they believe they will have problems making payments. Borrowers are provided with basic information on loan repayment options and provided access to Inceptia’s Student Loan Knowledge HQ website, which provides detailed information on all repayment plans, useful links and helpful tips. Since our counselors are educated in a variety of financial matters, they are ready to address general questions related to financial issues and all borrowers are provided a toll-free number for any future questions; providing a lifeline to a student loan expert.
* **Repayment Counseling Outreach (Outcome-Based)**  - Inceptia’s highly trained counselors contact student borrowers who are delinquent on their student loans to assist the borrower in resolving the delinquency. The service provides education to motivate student borrowers to take the necessary action to resolve their delinquency. Resolving delinquency sets the stage for reducing or maintaining a healthy Cohort Default Rate.
* **Financial Avenue** - Financial Avenue is an online financial education program that provides users with the knowledge and tools to become financially capable, while delivering dynamic and interactive content in the manner in which students prefer to learn. The program takes a holistic approach in providing courses relevant to the student lifecycle, with topics ranging from budgeting, to managing student loans, to planning for future life events like buying a home or saving for retirement. This focus on teaching users how to better manage their personal and educational finances while in school and beyond is the root of Financial Avenue’s mission: financial capability for all students as a component of overall student wellness.
