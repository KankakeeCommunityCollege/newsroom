The art installation will display outfits that have been recreated from the stories of survivors. It’s intended to reinforce the fact that the clothing doesn’t cause sexual violence, the person who causes harm is the one to blame. Through this project, KC-CASA seeks to help survivors find peace and to provide a moment of awareness for the KCC community.<br><br>*Provided by the Kankakee County Center Against Sexual Assault (KC-CASA)&nbsp;<br>Sponsored by KCC Student Life and Development*
