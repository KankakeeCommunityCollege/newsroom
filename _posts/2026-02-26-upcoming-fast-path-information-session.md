An information session about Kankakee Community Collge’s Fast Path transfer degree program in Watseka will be Thursday, March 5 at 5:30 p.m. at KCC’s Miner South Extension Center, 1488 E. Walnut, Watseka.

Visitors can learn more about the program, which offers a schedule of two classes a week for two years. The program leads to an Associate in Arts transfer degree. Participants complete two classes every eight weeks.

“Fast Path was a great choice for starting my college journey. It was affordable, helped me figure out my major, and fully prepared me to transfer to the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign,” said Addison Edwards, a 2024 Fast Path graduate. ![Addison Edwards, 2024 KCC Fast Path graduate](/uploads/2023/addisonedwards-300x200.jpg "Addison Edwards, 2024 KCC Fast Path graduate"){: width="300" height="200"}“KCC’s program mentor and professors were welcoming, supportive, and always available to help.”

The program admits a maximum of 20 students each fall, and a laptop is included.

“Fast Path students have a support system they can rely on,” said Nancy Schunke, program mentor and advisor. “We mentor, guide and coach each student. We want them to be successful. Our graduates are ready to transfer as juniors to a four-year college or university.”

Applications are now being accepted, and the ninth cohort of students will start classes in August. More information and application materials are at [fastpath.kcc.edu](http://fastpath.kcc.edu/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
