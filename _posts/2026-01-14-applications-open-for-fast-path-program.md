KCC’s Fast Path transfer degree program is accepting applications for Fall 2026.

“Fast Path at KCC was the perfect steppingstone between high school and university,” said Haven Barrett, a 2024 KCC Fast Path graduate. “The small classes, supportive staff, and a strong sense of community made all the difference.”

Barrett, a Watseka resident, is a senior at Eastern Illinois University studying communication disorders and sciences with a minor in psychology.

At KCC, Fast Path students complete two classes at a time, with a mix of in-person and online coursework. New classes begin every eight weeks during fall and spring semesters. After two years, students earn an Associate in Arts transfer degree.

“Students in the program benefit by taking the first two years of a bachelor’s degree close to home in Watseka,” said Nancy Schunke, the program director and adviser. “It simplifies college planning by having courses, dates and times prearranged.”

In-person classes are at the KCC South Extension Center, 1488 E. Walnut St. in Watseka.

“This program takes the guesswork out of college,” Schunke said. “Our students have a support system they can rely on. We mentor, guide and coach each student. Students receive the tools they need to be successful, including a new laptop, and assistance every step of the way. Our graduates are prepared to transfer to a four-year college or university.”

The Fall 2026 students will be the ninth Fast Path program cohort at KCC’s Watseka location. Classes begin in August.
