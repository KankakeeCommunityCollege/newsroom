## Preparing for and attending the Job Fair

“Preparation is a key to success for attending a job fair,” said Kim Schott, coordinator of career services at KCC. “One way to get ready is by attending a free workshop being offered before the event.”

The job fair workshops are listed at [kcc.edu/careerservices](http://www.kcc.edu/careerservices). They include[“Working a Job Fair: How to Improve Your Odds,”](https://www.enrole.com/kcc/jsp/course.jsp?categoryId=BF7C25B0&amp;courseId=LECT-9057) on Wednesday, Sept. 25. Other sessions concentrate on resumes, cover letters, job search skills and interview skills.<br>More than 50 businesses and industries will be at the Job Fair. Employers will conduct pre-screening interviews for full- and part-time positions. Manufacturers will be available to answer questions, accept applications/resumes, and to demonstrate their products.&nbsp;
