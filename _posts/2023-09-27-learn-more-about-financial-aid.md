**On Oct. 2 and Nov. 7:**&nbsp;KCC’s financial aid staff will educate students and parents on the ins and outs of paying for college. These presentations will have in-depth information on sources available to help cover the costs of college.

For scholarship application help, bring a list of extracurricular activities the student participated in and contact information for up to three references.

**On Jan. 17, Jan. 24 and Feb. 8:**&nbsp;The workshop concentrates on assistance filling out the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid), the form used at all two- and four-year colleges and universities to determine eligibility for federal and state grants, work-study programs, subsidized & unsubsidized student loans and some scholarships. Bring completed 2022 tax returns and W2s. Bring Federal Student Aid (FSA) ID, username and password for student and parent. Student/Parent FSA IDs must have separate email addresses.

“We recommend that all prospective students complete the FAFSA as soon as it becomes available this December, even if you are still deciding on a school,” said Kendra Souligne, KCC director of financial aid. “Your financial aid package starts with submitting your FAFSA, and we are here to help guide you through this process.”

To fill out a 2024-2025 FAFSA, participants will need their 2022 income information such as tax returns and W-2 forms, plus an FSA ID username and password. Separate FSA IDs are required for both the student and parent. Go to [studentaid.gov/fsa-id](https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/sign-in/landing)&nbsp;to create an account.
