Seventeen students representing eight local communities have joined the 2019 Kankakee Community College Fast Path degree program.&nbsp;

The program is called “Fast Path,” and it simplifies college planning by having all courses, dates and times prearranged and guaranteed. Fast Path students complete two classes at a time, meet two days a week, and move on to new classes every eight weeks. They will earn an Associate in Arts transfer degree in two years. Some coursework is online in the program, and in-person classes are at the KCC Harold and Jean Miner South Extension Center, 1488 E. Walnut St. in Watseka.&nbsp;

“This program has taken guesswork out of college,” said Rexann McKinley, KCC professor and program mentor. “Fast Path students have a support system they can rely on. We mentor, guide and coach each student. We want them to be successful.”

“We give the students the tools they need, including a new laptop and assist them every step of the way,” said Nancy Schunke, KCC South Extension Center coordinator. “Our graduates will be ready to transfer to a four-year college or university.”

The students are: Dioselin Andrade of Gilman; Jordan Bard of Iroquois; Vanessa Martinez of Kankakee; Ian Nemeth and Zachary Whitson of Martinton; Lindsey Huff of Milford; Camila Ochoa, Dalton Reed, Cole Stone and Elizabeth Trujillo, of Onarga; Emily Dluzak, Samantha Graves, Elizabeth Bisping, Nathan Conrad, Brock Horner and Jacqulynn Schill, of Watseka; and Wyatt Suver of Woodland.&nbsp;<br>“I chose the fast path program for a few reasons,” said Dalton Reed. “The first being that it is close to home and I don’t have to make a long drive and be at the main campus all day. Another reason is that the structure of the program keeps me on track in pursuing an associate’s degree.”&nbsp;

In August 2018, the inaugural group of 11 Fast Path students entered the program. All 11 are now sophomores. They have started classes and are also finalizing their decisions on where to transfer, Schunke said.

“I absolutely love this program\!” said Sadee Wuethrich, sophomore Fast Path student. “It is great for those students transferring right out of high school or for those looking to start their educational plan. The classes are consistent and the faculty and staff are extremely helpful.”

“Fast Path has helped teach me how to manage time and prepare me for transfer to another college after I receive my associate’s degree.” said Daniel Devine, sophomore Fast Path student.
