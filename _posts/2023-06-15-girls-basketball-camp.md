KCC is hosting a Girls Basketball Camp July 25, 26 and 27.

This camp features key fundamental emphasis and individual skill development. There will be an emphasis on shooting and dribbling. Players will also take part in light conditioning drills and discuss stretching and nutrition. Groups will be made up by age, size and skill to allow for more individual instruction.&nbsp;

There will be an emphasis on fun and being a "humbled competitor," said Casey Meister, KCC's head women's basketball coach, who is also a camp director.

The morning session, from 9:30 a.m. - noon, will be for girls entering grades 3-5. The afternoon session, 1-3:30 p.m., will be for girls entering grades 6-8. The schedule is subject to change, and groups may be combined if needed.&nbsp;

Each player will receive a camp shirt, peanut-free snacks, evaluation and the opportunity to win awards. Players should bring water bottles, clean gym shoes, proper attire of a T-shirt&nbsp; and shorts. Participants who use inhalers should bring them if needed.&nbsp;

The KCC Cavaliers Womenâ€™s Basketball Camp is directed by Meister along with KCC Assistant Coach Jennifer Coronelli, and current players.
