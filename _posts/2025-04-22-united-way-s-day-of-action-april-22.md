KCC students, the student trustee, and members of the Student Advisory Council volunteered for [United Way’s Day of Action](https://tockify.com/kankakeecc/detail/1901/1745344800000) April 22 and cleaned up at Jeffers Park in Kankakee.

It was on Earth Day — a fitting time to take action to help the environment.

Thank you for making a difference in the community! KCC’s volunteers showed how small local efforts can have a meaningful impact.
