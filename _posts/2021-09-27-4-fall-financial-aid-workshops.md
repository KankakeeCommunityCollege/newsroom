KCC is hosting workshops to help college-bound students and their parents understand the financial aid and scholarship process. Staff also will explain and clarify the types of aid which are available.

Each workshop includes how to fill out the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid), the form used at all two- and four-year colleges and universities to determine eligibility for federal and state grants, work-study programs, subsidized & unsubsidized student loans and some scholarships. On Oct. 5, there will also be information about KCC scholarships.

The schedule is:

* Tuesday, Oct. 5, 6-8 p.m. in KCC Room M120
* Thursday, Oct. 21, 6-8 p.m. in KCC Room M120
* Wednesday, Nov. 3, 6-8 p.m. in KCC Room M120
* Tuesday, Dec. 7, 6-8 p.m. in KCC Room M120

All sessions are provided as a public service and are open to students and parents regardless of the college they plan to attend.

The FAFSA becomes available Oct. 1. Applications for 2022-23 scholarships at KCC become available on Oct. 1.

“We recommend that everyone complete the FAFSA as soon as possible because most funds are distributed on a first-come, first-served basis,” said Kendra Souligne, KCC assistant director of financial aid. “Even if your plans aren’t finalized, your financial aid package starts with submitting a FAFSA.”

**In-person participants** will be asked to follow KCC’s procedures, including wearing a face covering and completing a [certification form](https://certify.kcc.edu/).
