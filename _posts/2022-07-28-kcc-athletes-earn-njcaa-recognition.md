Two athletic teams and 13 student-athletes at Kankakee Community College have earned recognition from the NJCAA for academic achievements during the 2021-22 academic year.

“Academic success has always been a high priority in the Athletic Department at KCC, and it is so important to our athletes as they transfer to four-year universities,” said Todd Post, KCC’s athletic director. “We are very proud of our student-athletes and have the resources available to assist them academically and athletically.”![Gage Velasquez](/uploads/2022/gage-velasquez-350x233.jpg "Gage Velasquez"){: .float-image-right width="350" height="233"}

* Men’s basketball, with a 3.05 team GPA, and six students with GPAs above 3.0; and

To be one of the top academic men’s basketball teams nationally is a big deal. Not only did we show we can accomplish our goals on the court, but off the court as well.”

Brown also mentioned staff who assisted players with study skills, advisement, and in college success.
