![](/uploads/bed-build-carpentry-veteran-event-redblueborder-285x300.jpg){: .float-image-right width="285" height="300"}The [KCC Veterans Association](http://www.kcc.edu/students/studentlife/clubs/Pages/veterans.aspx) in partnership with [Project Headspace & Timing](http://projectheadspaceandtiming.com/)&nbsp;and [Sleep In Heavenly Peace](https://www.shpbeds.org/chapter/il-kankakee-area)&nbsp;are having an event to build and deliver beds for local children in need.

Twenty veterans are needed to volunteer to build and/or deliver 30 beds for children in need this holiday season.

The event will be Saturday, Dec. 19 from 9 a.m. - noon, with deliveries afterward. The build portion of the event will be at the KCC Manufacturing & Industrial Technology Center, 2580 S. Route 45/52.

To participate, please contact Eric Peterson at&nbsp;[EricP@projectheadspaceandtiming.org](mailto:EricP@projectheadspaceandtiming.org).&nbsp;

Please note: The KCC Manufacturing & Industrial Technology Center is large enough that it will allow for physical distancing among volunteers. Please wear a mask and complete the self-certification at [certify.kcc.edu](certify.kcc.edu)&nbsp;before arriving.
