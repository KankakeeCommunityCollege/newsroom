While the treatment of eating disorders requires specialized training, it is important for all health care professionals to understand eating problems and weight concerns.

Kankakee Community College’s Office of Continuing Education and Career Services is offering a one-day training session, “Emotional and Binge Eating, Chronic Dieting, and Body Shame: What Clinicians Need to Know.”

The workshop will be Friday, Sept. 9 from 8:30 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. The cost is $99 per person.

A main topic will be how recovery from eating past fullness and bingeing is more than a matter of self-control, weight loss, or even understanding the emotional triggers.

The presenter is Judith Matz, a licensed clinical social worker who is a nationally recognized speaker on diet culture, binge eating, emotional eating, body image, and weight stigma.

Additional topics will be:

* The relationship between diet culture, eating problems and weight concerns;
* Five components of the diet-binge cycle;
* Three steps of attuned eating;
* Attitudes toward body size;
* Three strategies to cultivate a healthy body image; and
* The Health At Every Size&reg; paradigm.

Upon successful completion, 7 contact hours will be awarded to participants who are nurses, nursing home administrators, dietitians, social workers, and counselors.&nbsp;

This seminar is being offered both in-person and as a live webinar.
