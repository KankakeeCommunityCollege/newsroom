“I couldn’t be prouder of the profound accomplishment of our five teams who have attained Academic All-American status this year, with our women’s soccer team making the list for the first time in our institution’s history,” said Bryce Shafer, KCC’s athletic director. “(It) represents the best of what KCC athletics stand for: excellence and development on and off the field or court.”

The minimum team grade point average requirement is 3.0 to receive recognition. KCC’s teams qualifying for [NJCAA All-Academic Team status](https://d2o2figo6ddd0g.cloudfront.net/g/w/l0jxudk9w7hm2c/2022-23_NJCAA_Academic_Teams_of_the_Year_07-31-23.pdf) are:

* Women’s Soccer, 3.39 team GPA and 13 students with GPAs above 3.0
* Softball, 3.29 team GPA and 11 students with GPAs above 3.0
* Volleyball 3.23 team GPA and 8 students with GPAs above 3.0
* Men’s Soccer, 3.15 team GPA and 10 students with GPAs above 3.0
* Baseball, 3.0 team GPA and 20 students with GPAs above 3.0

Among the four women’s soccer teams from NJCAA Region 4 which earned the academic honor, the Cavaliers have the highest overall GPA.

“Enough cannot be said about the academic performance of both men’s and women’s soccer teams,” said head coach Mike Barclay. “To have both teams receive this recognition in the same year, and the top spot for our region in each sport, is amazing.”

“We set a goal at the beginning of the year to repeat as a team academic All-American,” said Keith Cooper, head softball coach. “The ladies were determined to![KCC Baseball team photo](/uploads/2023/baseballteam-350x233-1.jpg "KCC Baseball team photo"){: .float-image-right width="350" height="233"}&nbsp;achieve that goal and worked extremely hard to accomplish it.&nbsp; We are very proud of the championship mentality and the work they had both in the classroom and on the field.”

“One of our core goals every year as a baseball team is to attain an average GPA of 3.0,” said Shafer, who also serves as the head baseball coach. “We firmly believe that the pursuit of development and excellence on the field and in the classroom, shapes true champions.

Thirty KCC student-athletes received NJCAA honors for academic achievement during the 2022-23 school year.
