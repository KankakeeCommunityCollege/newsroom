Students are invited to join in, start up or support a Student Club this fall.

Participation builds leadership skills; helps you pursue an academic, social or special interest; and lets you go beyond your classes to meet other students and staff.

Students in clubs and organizations not only gain excellent leadership and learning experiences, but are more likely to succeed in college.

Get started during the virtual Club Rush/Club Fair and see how you can get involved and get connected.<br>6 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 1, 2020 and<br>6 p.m. Wednesday, Sept. 2, 2020

Prizes will be available for student attendees.<br>The meeting link is [https://meet.google.com/kur-uanb-cur](https://meet.google.com/kur-uanb-cur){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
