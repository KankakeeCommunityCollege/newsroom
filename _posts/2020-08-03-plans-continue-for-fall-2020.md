For Fall 2020, Kankakee Community College is planning ways to safely instruct students and still deliver courses which need to utilize specialized labs and other in-person meetings.&nbsp;

<div><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/cD3niIebY9c">This 45 second video</a> explains the plan (in brief) and includes the register.kcc.edu web page new students can use to start their enrollment.&nbsp;</p><p>For the most part, lecture classes will be online, with some having set time schedules and real-time communication, while others will have a more traditional online format where students set their own schedules.</p><p>Classes that have hands-on components will include online lectures and in-person elements which use social distancing, proper cleaning and disinfecting.</p><p>All plans are based on current information related to the COVID-19 pandemic. If the state of Illinois makes changes that affect the college, it will be shared as soon as possible.</p><p>The individual classes at www.kcc.edu/schedule show the online/virtual requirement as well as if there are in-person meeting times. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We are committed to keeping students on track to completing their educational goals,&rdquo; said Dr. Francesca Catalano, KCC&rsquo;s associate dean for Math, Science and Engineering. &ldquo;Through offering courses in different formats, we can still accommodate learning outcomes that are needed. Right next to student safety, we place the highest level of importance on quality of instruction, and we are making sure that it will remain high.&rdquo;</p><p>Courses which have an in-person component will use social distancing, maximum occupancies, cleaning and other guidelines to assure that students stay safe. KCC also is continuing all of its services to students, such as free tutoring, advisement, and career services. Most services are offered online.</p><p>KCC is accepting enrollments for Fall 2020, which begins Aug. 17.&nbsp;</p><p>The college has online and in-person advisement appointments for returning students, available at&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://kccadvising.setmore.com/https://kccadvising.setmore.com/">https://kccadvising.setmore.com/</a>. Returning students also can register online or contact an advisor for information on registering.</p><p>New students are asked to complete an application at&nbsp;<a href="https://apply.kcc.edu/">https://apply.kcc.edu</a>&nbsp;or request information through&nbsp;<a href="https://register.kcc.edu/">https://register.kcc.edu</a>. New students take part in an online Cav Day orientation experience before registering.</p></div>
