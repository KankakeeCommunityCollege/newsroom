![](/uploads/2022/vetceremony400x225.jpg){: .center-image}<br>On Thursday, Nov. 9, Kankakee Community College will commemorate Veterans Day with a reception and recognition ceremony.

The day will begin with a reception from 11:30 a.m. - 1 p.m. in the KCC Cavalier Room. A ceremony honoring veterans will be at 1 p.m. in the college’s auditorium. Both events are free and the public is invited.

Posting of the colors will be from the Marine Corps League Detachment 1253.

During the ceremony, KCC’s Veterans Association and its leaders will be recognized.

“The Veterans Association provides a close-knit community, camaraderie, a gateway to leadership development, and accessibility to benefits,” said Kendra Souligne, director of financial aid & student engagement. “This organization facilitates outreach within the community to those who have served as well as their families.”

“KCC is proud to serve and provide an education for students who have served our country,” added Megan Ponton, assistant director of financial aid & veteran services. “We are committed to helping veterans as they return to college life.”

KCC Veterans Association officers for 2023-24 are: Jieun Loney, Navy veteran, president; Sadie Piehl, Army veteran, vice president; Bryce Reynolds, Marine Corps veteran, secretary; and Juan Perez, Army veteran, treasurer/prior year president.

An update will also be shared about the Mark Rodriguez Memorial Scholarship during the event. Rodriguez, a Marine Corps veteran who attended KCC from 2015-2018, helped found the KCC Veterans Resource Center and was an influential officer amongst the Veterans Association members. He passed away in February 2018, and KCC awarded him an honorary degree in May 2018. A $500 annual scholarship is now offered in his honor.

The Veterans Association at KCC is open to KCC students and staff who are military veterans, members of the military community, and supporters. It is an approved chapter of Student Veterans of America and SALUTE Veterans National Honor Society​.
