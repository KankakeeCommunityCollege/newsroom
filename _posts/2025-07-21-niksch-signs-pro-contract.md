An All-American pitcher from KCC has signed with the Milwaukee Brewers.

Peyton Niksch, a 6-foot tall right-hander from Lowell, Indiana,  signed a minor league contract with the Brewers on July 15.

In his sophomore season at KCC, Niksch was a 1<sup>st</sup> Team All-American in NJCAA Div. II Region 4 Player of the Year. For the 2025 season, Niksch had a 1.36 ERA; 107 strikeouts; and a perfect Game vs. Olney Central College on Sunday, March 2.

In two years at KCC, Niksch earned 16 Wins, had 178 Strikeouts and a 2.22 ERA.

“I’m incredibly excited for Peyton as he begins the next chapter with the Milwaukee Brewers,” said Bryce Shafer, KCC’s baseball coach and athletic director. “He’s earned this opportunity with all the hard work, discipline, and dedication that he has shown here at KCC. Watching him chase his dream of becoming a big leaguer is something truly special, and I couldn’t be more proud of the person and player he has become. I’ll be following closely as he competes against the best in the world. This is just the beginning for him.”

Another distinction for Niksch is that he earned a 4.0 GPA at KCC, earning an Associate in Arts Transfer degree.
