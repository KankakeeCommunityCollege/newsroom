KCC’s Hammes Bookstore has created a survey for students and the community.

Please provide input on what you’d like to see and buy in the Bookstore. Items, sizes, colors, and more – please share.

Though the staff can’t guarantee every suggestion gets to the shelves, they do want to explore ideas before the spring buying season.

To participate, visit [https://bit.ly/KCCBookstoreSurvey2025](https://bit.ly/KCCBookstoreSurvey2025) on or before Oct. 31.

Thank you.
