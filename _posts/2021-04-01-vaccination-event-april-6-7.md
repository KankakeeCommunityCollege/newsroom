Those who qualify to receive the vaccine under Phase 1a, 1b and 1c guidelines can make an appointment for this site at [https://events.juvare.com/IL-IDPH/395de829-155c-46d1-bc8c-ecbfda9ab166/](https://events.juvare.com/IL-IDPH/395de829-155c-46d1-bc8c-ecbfda9ab166/). Appointments are required.

Plans are in place to administer 700 vaccinations per day. The vaccine will be from Johnson & Johnson. Illinois National Guard personnel will be on site to support processing, paperwork, vaccinations and observations.

“The moment we knew that vaccinations were available, we offered our campus as a distribution site,” said Dr. Michael Boyd, KCC president. “KCC is a familiar place for so many residents and that’s why it is a great place to host a vaccination site. It's our hope that all residents who qualify for the vaccine can receive it. It is a privilege to serve our community during the COVID-19 recovery process.”
