KCC's chapter of [Phi Theta Kappa](http://www.kcc.edu/ptk) is selling Fannie May candies and chocolates at a discount compared to the in-store price.

To place an order, contact any member of Phi Theta Kappa or the co-advisor, [Jackie Cruz](mailto:jcruz@kcc.edu?subject=Fannie%20May%20sale). Orders are due by the end of the day Friday, Nov. 15.

To ensure that they can be used as holiday gifts, the special treats will arrive and be distributed before the end of finals week.
