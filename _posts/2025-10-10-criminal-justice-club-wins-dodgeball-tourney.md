Members of KCC's Criminal Justice Club participated in the “Play for a Purpose Adult Field Day” for Harbor House on DATE.

The club had enough entrants to field two teams in the dodgeball competition - then both teams made it to the finals. In the end "Team 1" prevailed as tournament champions.

All participants enjoyed the opportunity to be involved in the community for the cause of domestic violence.

**Team 1:** Paul Brazeau, Makenzie Yore, Sally Hijab, Reem Hijab, Kollin Asbury, Trey Blanchette, Dermetrious Linsey, Clay Gadbois and Joseph Catalano.

**Team 2:** Chris Medina, Brayden Wittoft, Hunter Rapier, Jimmy Lazaro, Emmet Powell, Ben Kiracofe, Drew Stabler and Hank Vandemeer.
