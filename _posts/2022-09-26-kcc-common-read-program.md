![KCC Common Read logo](/uploads/2022/kcc-common-read250x250.jpg "KCC Common Read"){: .float-image-right width="250" height="250"}The inaugural KCC Common Read program will begin on Tuesday, Sept. 27 with a kick-off celebration in the College Center from 11 a.m. â€“ 1 p.m., and comments at 12:15 p.m.

The title selected for this year's campus and community KCC Common Read is *American Like Me*, *Reflections of Life Between Cultures*, edited by America Ferrera.

Ferrera is an actress from popular recent movies and television including *Ugly Betty*, *Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants*&nbsp;and *Superstore*.&nbsp; The book features chapters from Issa Rae, Jeremy Lin, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and Padma Lakshmi, among others, discussing their experiences navigating their connections to more than one culture and their struggles in finding connection and belonging.

The KCC Common Read will run through April 2023 with at least one event per month. It is open to anyone who would like to participate--students, faculty, staff and members of the community.

Reading schedules and event information will be available at the kick-off event. No reading needs to be done prior to Sept. 27. Program information will also be available&nbsp; after Sept. 27.

The book is available from a number of local and online sources. Anyone who would like to buy an extra copy for a student--or provide the funding needed for one copy--can bring $12.49 (the cost on [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=american+like+me+america+ferrera&amp;crid=1ALIMB1F306TX&amp;sprefix=american+like+%2Caps%2C93&amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_2_14){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}) or a copy of the book to the KCC Miner Memorial Library.
