In March 2020, when Kankakee Community College began online instruction to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the KCC Foundation stepped in with $5,000 to provide laptops that could be loaned to students who needed them.<br>The computers were loaned to 56 students, at no charge, to use for the remainder of the spring semester. The college also loaned wi-fi hotspots to 27 students who needed an internet connection.<br>When online learning continued, the Foundation decided that students who returned for Summer 2020 could keep the computers and wi-fi devices. To date, 21 students have been able to keep their laptops, and 10 have been able to keep their hotspots. &nbsp;<br><br>“An anonymous group of donors gave an additional $3,050 donation specifically for the purchase of laptops and wi-fi devices for students,” said Kelly Myers, executive director of the KCC Foundation. “We are ordering additional laptops for students with those funds to assist with their technology needs.”<br><br>Also, to fund the continuing needs of students, the Foundation will host its first “Give Day” on Thursday, Aug. 27, 2020.&nbsp;<br><br>“During this virtual, peer-to-peer fundraising event, we are asking alumni, donors and friends of the college to support students who need laptops or wi-fi devices for the Fall 2020 semester and beyond,” Myers said. “Our goal is to give all KCC students who have demonstrated need the resources to ensure their success.”<br><br>The event already has secured several gifts that will provide matching funds for the first $10,000 raised. The Give Day fundraiser will also support creation of a new Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Center at KCC.&nbsp;<br><br>To make a donation to Give Day on or before Aug. 27, go to [www.kcc.edu/giveday](https://foundation.kcc.edu/events/giveday/){: target="_blank"} or mail a check payable to KCC Foundation, Inc. to KCC Foundation, 100 College Drive, Kankakee IL 60901.
