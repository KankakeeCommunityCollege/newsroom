The military friendly schools list has 26 Illinois colleges on it.  According to Victory Media, which publishes “GI Jobs,” schools were evaluated using both public data sources and responses from its own survey. “Schools who achieve designation show true commitment and dedication in their efforts,” said Kayla Lopez, National Director of Military Partnerships for Military Friendly. “Our standards assist schools by providing a benchmark that promotes positive educational outcomes, resources, and support services that better the educational landscape and provide opportunity for the Military Community.” The 2021-22 Military Friendly® Schools list will be published in the May issue of G.I. Jobs magazine and at militaryfriendly.com. For more information about educational benefits for military veterans, spouses and dependents, visit kcc.edu/veterans.
