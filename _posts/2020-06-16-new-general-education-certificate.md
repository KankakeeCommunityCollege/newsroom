Kankakee Community College has a new certificate for students planning to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree in any area.<br>According to the iTransfer.org website, “The GECC transfers as a package to satisfy the general education requirements at participating IAI (Illinois Articulation Initiative) schools to help you with progress towards completing your degree.”&nbsp;<br>IAI is a statewide transfer agreement, which is transferable among more than 100 participating colleges and universities in Illinois. As noted on the iTransfer website, it is particularly beneficial to students who haven’t decided on their major or transfer destination.<br>The IAI is essentially a way for students to begin their undergraduate experience with confidence, said Jennifer Hays Huggins, KCC’s associate dean of humanities and social sciences.<br>“All colleges and universities participating in IAI agree to accept a ‘package’ of IAI general education courses in lieu of their own comparable lower-division general education requirements,” the iTransfer site states. “Keep in mind, the IAI general education transfers as a package. Any course-to-course transfer credit is not guaranteed. You should work with your institutions to see exactly how your courses will transfer beyond the IAI package.”<br>There are a minimum of 37 required credits to complete the general education core credential certificate at KCC. The classes must be selected from an approved list. The requirements are: Introductory Speech, English I, English II, three social and behavioral science courses, three humanities courses, one mathematics course, one life science course, and one physical science course. The classes can also be used toward any Associate in Arts, which typically require 60 to 64 credit hours.<br>For more information, complete a request for information at info.kcc.edu, email [advising@kcc.edu](mailto:advising@kcc.edu) or phone the college’s advisement office at 815-802-8500.<br>&nbsp;
