Kankakee resident Tim Wilhelm recently created a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/nlpZC2asmGs){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}&nbsp;for a KCC class.&nbsp;![](/uploads/2022/stem-guitar-person250x222.jpg){: .float-image-right width="250" height="222"}

Wilhelm–who taught at KCC full-time from 1997 until 2017–shares his experiences taking classes post-retirement.

"The video has a number of great points about KCC classes, including that people over age 60 don't have to pay tuition – the just&nbsp; pay fees of $19 per credit, plus any individual course fees," said Ellen Schmidt, who works in KCC's Office of Marketing and Public Relations. "Although this is not an official KCC video, it has a great message that we are proud to share with the community."
