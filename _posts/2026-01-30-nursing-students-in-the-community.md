On Saturday, January 17, six students from the [Student Nurses Association](https://www.kcc.edu/student-resources/student-life/clubs/#student-nurses-association "Student Nurses Association"){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, along with six nursing faculty members, volunteered to help build beds for a [Sleep in Heavenly Peace](https://shpbeds.org/chapter/il-kankakee-area/ "Sleep in Heavenly Peace"){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} event.

They worked at the Bourbonnais Lowe's to help provide beds to children in need, guided by the Sleep in Heavenly Peace mission: "No kid sleeps on the floor in our town!"
