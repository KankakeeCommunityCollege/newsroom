KCC students are invited to meet with a personal counselor to discuss issues including anxiety, work-life balance, relationships, life transitions, stress management and LGBT/QIA.

Counseling is confidential. The first five sessions are free for enrolled KCC students.

For long-term-treatment, insurance, self-pay and sliding scale payments are accepted. The therapist at KCC is Stephanie Ochoa. &nbsp;
