On Friday, Oct. 25, Kankakee Community College held a recognition ceremony to honor 40 employees for service at the college.&nbsp;

Yeoman started at KCC on Feb. 19, 1974. He is currently the assistant director of the Physical Plant Department.&nbsp;

“Brian has been instrumental in the maintenance and running of the college facilities,” said Rich Soderquist, director of KCC’s Physical Plant Department. “Starting as an electrician and working his way into the administration of the physical plant, he has been involved in all aspects of the college’s daily operations, and has been an important part of KCC’s expansion into what now includes the main Riverfront Campus and three extension centers totaling almost 450,000 square feet of buildings and 185 acres of campus grounds, all of which supports the college’s educational programs.”
