Kankakee Community College is hosting free FAFSA workshops for college-bound students and their parents in August.

“It’s not too late to get financial aid,” said Kendra Souligne, KCC director of financial aid. “KCC’s financial aid staff will provide assistance filling out the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid).” The workshops also explain and clarify the types of aid which are available, she said.

Each workshop will feature giveaways of KCC merchandise and refreshments. Morning sessions will feature Essential Smoothies, and evening sessions will feature Nothing Bundt Cakes®. On Aug. 22, participants will receive bonus KCC merchandise.

Reservations are not required.

[FAFSA](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa) is used at all two- and four-year colleges and universities to determine eligibility for federal and state grants, work-study programs, subsidized & unsubsidized student loans and some scholarships.

Participants should bring completed 2022 tax returns and W2s. A Federal Student Aid ID, username and password is also needed for both students and parents. The student and the parent FSA IDs must have separate email addresses. FSA IDs can be created at [studentaid.gov/fsa-id](https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/sign-in/landing).

Workshops in English:

* Wednesday, Aug. 7, 6-8 p.m. in KCC Room M120

The workshops are provided as a public service and are open to students and parents regardless of the college they plan to attend.

“We recommend that all prospective students complete the FAFSA, even if you are still deciding on a school,” Souligne said. “Your financial aid package starts with submitting your FAFSA, and we are here to help guide you through this process.”
