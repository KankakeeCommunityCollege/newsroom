To participate, kids under age 12 are invited to download a coloring sheet, color it and send it back by June 15. There are two ways to return the coloring sheets: in person at the KCC North Extension Center, 450 N. Kinzie Ave. in Bradley; or by taking a photo of the entry and sending it by email to [wmittons@kcc.edu](mailto:wmittons@kcc.edu).

Prizes will be awarded to one participant from each age group: ages 4-6, ages 7-9 & ages 10-12.&nbsp;

Complete details are on the [Center for Equity, Diversity & Inclusion page](https://www.kcc.edu/student-resources/edi/).&nbsp;

Juneteenth is a federal holiday in the U.S., commemorating the emancipation of enslaved African-Americans. It has been celebrated annually in the United States on June 19 since 1865.
