The renovation of the Miner Memorial Library into the KCC Student Success Center is underway.

![](/uploads/library-north-looking-east.jpg){: .float-image-left width="355" height="252"}&nbsp;During construction, all library services are operating out of KCC Room D212, on the second floor of the Workforce Development Center, next to the Foundation Office. &nbsp;

![](/uploads/tutoring-looking-east.jpg){: width="395" height="251"}&nbsp;Quiet study for students is available in Room L369, a classroom next to the division offices on the third floor. Room L369 is reserved for the entire renovation project as a space where students can read and study without interruption or noise. &nbsp;

![](/uploads/library-south-looking-east.jpg){: .center-image width="377" height="248"}&nbsp;Other spaces for group and individual study are listed on the[Library FAQ page](https://kcc.libanswers.com/library/faq/270883){: target="_blank"}.

&nbsp;There also are a couple of computers in Room D212 (the temporary library) for research assistance. Students who just need a computer to work on homework or other tasks can use the [guide to other computer/printer locations](https://kcc.libanswers.com/library/faq/270159){: target="_blank"}. Generally speaking, students may use any computer lab where a class is not currently being held - check the sign on the door for that roomâ€™s schedule.

The new Student Success Center is scheduled to open before the Fall 2020 semester begins. Some renderings of how it will look are included as part of this article.

**Hours**

Beginning Jan. 13, the library hours in Room D212 will be 7 a.m. - 6 p.m. Monday - Thursday, and 7 a.m. - 4 pm Fridays.&nbsp;
