The Office of Continuing Education and Business Partnerships at Kankakee Community College is offering discounted rates for non-credit workforce training as part of Illinois Community College’s Behind Every Employer Illinois campaign.

“The Behind Every Employer Illinois campaign is a proactive effort to reach businesses that need customized training to teach their workers technical or soft skills onsite or at a location near them, business solutions such as operational reviews and leadership training to build efficiencies, no-cost basic literacy and English Language acquisition for their workers, and the opportunity to partner with our network on internships and advisory committees,” said ICCB deputy director for workforce education, Whitney Thompson.

In KCC’s district, businesses of all sizes can qualify for benefits, said Gina Greene, Ed.D., director of the Continuing Education and Business Partnerships Office at KCC.

“Vouchers are being offered for professional development classes at KCC,” Greene said. “KCC can also bring the training to you. Employers can have in-house training at a discounted rate.

“Continuing education benefits companies and their workers,” Greene continued. “KCC offers a wide range of topics for increasing workforce skills and knowledge without a commitment to a full-time or degree program.”

As a grant recipient, KCC can help employers train people in numerous continuing education areas, including computer skills, safety, leadership and management.

Each year, an average of 1,500 people take part in non-credit workforce training and professional development. Each year, there are 15 to 20 on-site workforce training sessions, Greene said.

Companies in Kankakee and Iroquois counties can learn more about utilizing KCC for training by contacting Greene at [ggreene@kcc.edu](mailto:ggreene@kcc.edu) or go to [www.kcc.edu/behindeveryemployerillinois](http://www.kcc.edu/behindeveryemployerillinois)*.* The statewide website is [https://behindeveryemployerillinois.org/](https://behindeveryemployerillinois.org/).
