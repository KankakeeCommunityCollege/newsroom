"Normally, our student ticket price is $17 per person," the KVTA president, Courtney Stephens, said. "For this production only, we would like to offer your students $10 tickets per person to enjoy this fantastic musical!

"This musical is a great option for any clubs or organizations, for those of Hispanic heritage or BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of color)."

Show dates are April 29, 30, May 6 and 7.
