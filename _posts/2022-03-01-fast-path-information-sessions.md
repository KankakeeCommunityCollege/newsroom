Information sessions about KCC’s Fast Path transfer degree program will be held at KCC’s Miner South Extension Center in Watseka on Wednesday, March 16 at 6 p.m., or a virtual Zoom session will be offered on Wednesday, March 23 at 6 p.m. &nbsp;

The Fast Path Program uses a schedule of two classes at a time, two days a week for students to earn an Associate in Arts transfer degree in two years all in Watseka. New classes begin every eight weeks. Students will be in class for about three hours a day, two days a week. The course sequence, dates and times are prearranged and guaranteed.

“We’ve done the planning, and taken the guesswork out of college,” said Nancy Schunke, KCC Miner South Extension Center Coordinator and Fast Path advisor. &nbsp;“Fast Path students will have a support system they can rely on. We mentor, guide and coach each student and give them the tools they need to be successful, including a new laptop.”

Olivia Henning, current Fast Path student told us, “The Fast Path program helped me ease into college. The classes in the program are well thought out and fun. The mentor and staff are helpful and provide support throughout the program. It was a great choice for me.”

The program admits a maximum of 20 students each fall.&nbsp;<br>Applications are now being accepted, and classes will begin in Aug. 2022.&nbsp;<br>For questions or to reserve a seat at the information session, contact Schunke at [nschunke@kcc.edu](mailto:nschunke@kcc.edu) or phone 815-802-8784.&nbsp;<br>Please see a detailed flier about the program and a brief video of what current Fast Path students have to say about their experience.<br>![](/uploads/2021/fastpath-detailedflyer.png){: width="643" height="835"}
