"Thank You" cards will be available to write a note to a veteran at the Manteno Veterans Home.

The KCC Vet Center also will be collecting videos of people saying "Hello," "Thank for your service," "We love you," "Thinking of you," and any other positive message to the veterans at the Manteno Veterans Home. The videos will use a Drop Box account. The Veterans Home will display these videos for the residents to see.
