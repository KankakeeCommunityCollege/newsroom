Kankakee Community College has received a $390,000 Job Training Economic Development (JTED) grant for students in its manufacturing, information technology and welding programs.

The Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity grant funds students’ tuition, fees, books and supplies, and assists with other expenses. It is available to students enrolled in manufacturing and information technology programs, industries where there are not enough local workers. Recipients must be between 18-24 years old.

"This development grant invests in the future of our community," said Dr. Michael Boyd, KCC’s president. "By aligning our training programs with the needs of local employers and providing robust support services, we’re empowering our residents to build better futures for themselves and their families.”

KCC received the JTED grant because the college serves three communities—Kankakee, Hopkins Park and Pembroke—identified as part of the Illinois Restore, Reinvest, Renew initiative. Another factor for eligibility was having a workforce which could benefit from learning the skills needed to fill family-sustaining jobs in emerging sectors.

“This grant will assure that individuals that are seeking short-term training solutions for longer-term employment options can proceed in gaining the sought after skills sets,” said Paul Carlson, KCC dean of KCC’s Business, Technology & Human Services Division. “Many advisory committee member employers have identified students in Manufacturing or IT or Welding simply due to the student being enrolled and becoming noticed. What an exciting time for students and employers to be able to match needs, and now (with) these grant funds even more connection could be made.”

Carlson added that the program adds value because it allows students “to offset the immediate concern of costs … on day one of their studies.”

“There is an immediate solution for employers that seek highly skilled employees, and for students to locate long sought-after family sustaining wages while not being strapped for the costs of school,” Carlson said.

Programs eligible for funding include advanced manufacturing, information technology support, web development, and welding. KCC’s has options for industry-recognized credentials in PC support, Java software development, manufacturing production, and welding.

Grant recipients will receive personalized career planning and assessments. Services will include financial literacy education, digital literacy, job search assistance, transportation, and childcare support. Students will work with KCC's career planners to outline their goals, identify necessary training, and develop strategies for overcoming obstacles to employment.

**“**The JTED grant aligns with KCC’s long-standing mission to serve as an anchor institution for economic development in the region,” Boyd said. “The college is committed to addressing educational disparities and supporting the local workforce in adapting to a rapidly changing job market.”

The JTED grant is made possible by a collaboration among KCC, local businesses, government agencies, and community organizations.

Boyd said KCC is committed to making sure participants can continue their education and training even if the JTED funding expires. The college will assist qualified students with additional funding sources such as Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act, Perkins grants, and KCC Foundation resources, he said.
