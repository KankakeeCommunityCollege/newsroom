The Fast Path Degree program offered by Kankakee Community College at the Harold and Jean Miner South Extension Center in Watseka will have an online information session on Tuesday, May 19 from 6-7 p.m.&nbsp;

Fast Path offers students a schedule of two classes at a time, two days a week. Two classes are completed every eight weeks. After two years, they earn an Associate in Arts transfer degree.

“The Fall 2020 students will be in class for about three hours a day on Mondays and Wednesdays,” said Rexann McKinley, KCC professor and program mentor. “The course sequence, dates and times are all preplanned to make it easy on the students.”

More information will be available at the event May 19. To participate, email [rmckinley@kcc.edu](mailto:rmckinley@kcc.edu) to receive login details.

“The dedicated mentor and added support services available in the Fast Path program have helped me make a smooth transition from high school to college,” said Daniel Devine, who will complete a Fast Path A.A. degree this month. “This program has taught me the skills I need to be a successful college student in class and online.”

The program admits up to 20 students each fall, and a laptop is included.&nbsp;

We want them to be successful. Our graduates will be ready to transfer as juniors to a four-year college or university.”

Applications are being accepted, and classes will begin Aug. 17, 2020. More information and application materials are at [fastpath.kcc.edu](https://fastpath.kcc.edu/){: target="_blank"}.&nbsp;
