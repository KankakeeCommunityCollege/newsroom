On Saturday, March 12, two members of the Health Careers Honors Cohort joined the program mentor in a spring service project.

The food pantry is located at Asbury United Methodist Church in Kankakee, and it serves the community every Saturday morning.  

The group spent the morning setting out food items, assisted in the distribution of the food, and cleaning up afterward.

KCC’s Health Careers Honors program gives qualified students a route to earn guaranteed entry into a KCC Health Careers program. Once admitted, students in the program have an initial semester of general education courses which includes required tutoring sessions. Leadership and other honors activities are introduced as well.

The program accepts up to 20 students each fall and spring semester. More information is at <https://healthhonors.kcc.edu>.
