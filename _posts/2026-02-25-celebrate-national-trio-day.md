Kankakee Community College is celebrating the 40th Annual National TRIO Day on Saturday, Feb. 28, 2026.

National TRIO Day recognizes the transformative impact of the Federal TRIO programs and honors the achievements of first-generation, income-eligible students, students with disabilities and veterans pursuing higher education.

“I understand firsthand the barriers that many students may face,” said Lisa Davis, who was a first-generation college student when she attended KCC. She is now assistant director of [TRIO Student Support Services](https://www.kcc.edu/trio "www.kcc.edu/trio"){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} at the college.

“TRIO provides academic support and resources that promote persistence, completion, and college transfer readiness for our students to overcome barriers that may be between them and their dreams,” Davis said. “The hope is that our TRIO students are reminded that they are supported and do not have to navigate their educational journey alone.”

The TRIO program at KCC serves 833 students through three programs: Upward Bound, Student Support Services, and Talent Search. KCC Upward Bound has 78 high school-age students; KCC Talent Search has 600 students who have completed 5th grade and are at least 11 years old; and KCC Student Support Services has 155 KCC students.

“As a TRIO McNair Scholar and now assistant director of [TRIO Upward Bound](https://upwardbound.kcc.edu/ "upwardbound.kcc.edu"){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, my journey with TRIO has come full circle,” said Joel M. Tokarczyk of KCC. “As a first-generation, low-income, and nontraditional student, higher education often felt out of reach. I had dreams for my future, but I did not always have a clear path toward achieving them.

“Looking back, I often wish there had been a program like Upward Bound available to me when I was in high school,” Tokarczyk continued. “I am grateful that TRIO welcomed me as an undergraduate through the McNair program and helped me find direction, confidence, and a belief in what was possible. Today, I am proud to help ensure that our Upward Bound students receive that support earlier in their journey, so they can see their futures clearly and step into them with confidence.”

TRIO programs provide academic guidance, tutoring, advising, mentoring, college readiness services, financial aid support, and career development opportunities for eligible students. Nationally, TRIO serves more than 800,000 individuals each year, including middle school, high school, and college students, adult learners, veterans, and graduate scholars.

“Students need people to empower them to believe in their potential, persist through obstacles, and achieve their educational and career goals,” said Melany Duax, assistant director of [TRIO Talent Search](https://talentsearch.kcc.edu/ "https://talentsearch.kcc.edu/"){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} at KCC. “I understand firsthand the challenges many TRIO students face. As a low-income student navigating higher education largely on my own, I experienced the uncertainty, stress, and pressure of starting and completing college without a clear roadmap. Those experiences shape my dedication to ensuring TRIO Talent Search students have the guidance, encouragement, and resources I once needed.”

National TRIO Day was established by Congress in 1986. Federal TRIO programs were created through the landmark Higher Education At to remove barriers to postsecondary education. More than 6 million TRIO students have earned college degrees, according to the Council for Opportunity in Education.
