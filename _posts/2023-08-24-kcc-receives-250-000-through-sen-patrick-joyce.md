This funding will play a pivotal role in advancing Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) education and positively impacting workforce development in Kankakee County and the region.

“Our commitment is that these resources will drive improvements to STEM education and manufacturing,” Boyd continued. Boyd also said he appreciates Sen. Joyce’s recognition of KCC’s role in workforce development.

“Career opportunities in advanced STEM fields are growing rapidly in our community,” Boyd said. “Local advanced manufacturers like Kensing, Valspar, MilliporeSigma and CSL Behring, need a STEM-prepared workforce.”&nbsp;

Training in these programs can be completed within a few weeks to 24 months.&nbsp;

"Dr. Boyd stands as a dedicated advocate for collaboration between academia and local manufacturing, and the perfect partner in this endeavor is undoubtedly KCC,” Joyce said. “Our ongoing dialogues with local employers like CSL Behring only reinforce the importance of this partnership. Through engagement with high schools and KCC on STEM programs, we're setting the foundation for a skilled workforce. At KCC, one can stride towards further education or seamlessly transition into the workforce – a testament to our commitment to shaping a prosperous future.

“Kankakee County is now&nbsp;[ranked third for manufacturing hubs (small)](https://businessfacilities.com/business-facilities-2023-metro-rankings-report/)&nbsp;in the United States,” Joyce continued. “As we lay the groundwork for expansive manufacturing facilities locally, with its promise of numerous well-paying jobs, it becomes imperative to align our efforts.”
