**From Kaitlyn Medina, a KCC sophomore:**

“I believe that KCC was the best choice for me coming straight out of high school, it provided an affordable and close to home option for me to continue my education. I wasn’t ready to head straight into a four year university right after high school so KCC allowed me to smoothly transition into discovering what it is I what to pursue a career in. KCC gave me the opportunity to take my general courses that I am required to take at an affordable price with some amazing professors. Now that I’m about to complete my associates degree here at KCC I have a better idea of what careers I would like to pursue, and I feel prepared to transition over to a university now.”
