It will prepare you to identify risk factors, clinical presentation and management of heart disease in women. In addition, you will learn to confidently care for women with takosubo cardiomyopathy and peripartium cardiomyopathy.”

Other topics will include recognizing specific symptoms and outlining a plan of care.&nbsp;

“This will be an educational seminar to help build cutting edge skills to care for women with heart disease,” said Debra Hoyer-Denson, KCC assistant dean of continuing education and career services.

The heart disease seminar will be presented as a live webinar from 8 a.m. - 12:15 p.m. Thursday, Nov. 19. The price is $55.
