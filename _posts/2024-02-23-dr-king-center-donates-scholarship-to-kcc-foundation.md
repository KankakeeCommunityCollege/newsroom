"We chose to give this gift to the KCC Foundation because KCC embodies the same spirit of hope and opportunity that the Dr. King Education Center instilled in our community,” said Hunter. “Education is the pathway to a brighter future, and KCC's commitment to empowering students aligns perfectly with our mission."

“By supporting KCC, we continue the legacy of providing hope and opportunity to future generations,” said Davis. “Today, we honor Judy Thomas's memory along with the countless individuals whose lives were touched by the center's transformative work.”

Thomas was the long-time Dr. King Education Center business manager. She passed away in 2014. Her son, Dr. Brad Thomas, attended the ceremonial check presentation.

“Judy embodied the center's compassionate ethos, and her generous spirit continues to inspire and guide our efforts,” Bigott said. “Her dedication and tireless advocacy for individuals seeking education and support left an impact on the community. We are very grateful to have her son Brad with us to commemorate this gift.”

Established in 1968, the Dr. King Education Center collaborated closely with KCC, fostering a culture of learning and empowerment. Its comprehensive programs encompassed adult basic education, GED preparation, job skills training, English as a second language instruction, and parenting skills development. KCC continues to offer all of those programs.

“Kankakee Community College remains deeply grateful for the enduring partnership and support of the Dr. King Education Center,” said Kari Nugent, vice president for advancement at KCC.

KCC’s Department of Adult and Community Education offers classes for area adults who are ready to complete grade school or high school requirements. There are no costs to enroll or for books. The programs are open to anyone age 17 and older who is no longer attending high school. They also are for adults who do not speak English as their first language and want to improve their English to obtain employment or improve employment opportunities.
