In addition, businesses of all sizes in Kankakee and Iroquois counties can also qualify for benefits from the grant to offer customized training, said Gina Greene, Ed.D., director of the Continuing Education and Business Partnerships Office at KCC.

“Vouchers are being offered,” Greene said. “KCC can also bring the training to you. Employers can have in-house training at a discounted rate.

“Continuing education benefits companies and their workers,” Greene continued. “KCC offers a wide range of topics for increasing workforce skills and knowledge without a commitment to a full-time or degree program.”

As a grant recipient, KCC can help employers train people in numerous continuing education areas, including computer skills, safety, leadership and management.

Each year, an average of 1,500 people take part in non-credit workforce training and professional development at KCC, Greene said.
