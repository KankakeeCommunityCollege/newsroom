Five new painting classes are being offered this spring in Kankakee Community College’s Continuing Education Department.

The classes, which do not award college credit, give participants step-by-step instructions to make their own paintings. At the end of the class, each person gets to take their painting home. Beginners are welcome at every session, and no previous skills are required. Supplies, including a 9 inch by 12 inch canvas, are provided. Each class is led by Patti Shidler in KCC Room D151.&nbsp;
