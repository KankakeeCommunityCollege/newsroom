The free event is from 10-11:30 a.m. Friday, Sept. 8 at KCC in the Iroquois Room. Weather permitting, several classic Studebakers will be on display outside.

For over 60 years, Hodak Motors was a staple of the Kankakee community, providing quality automobiles and exceptional customer service. Two brothers who grew up around the family business, Mark and Doug Hodak, will present highlights of the auto dealership, and how their grandfather was an inspiring example of the American dream.
