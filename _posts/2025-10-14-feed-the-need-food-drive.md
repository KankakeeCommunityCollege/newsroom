![Community Colleges Feed The Need Campus Food Drive logo](/uploads/2023/feed-the-need250x284.png "Feed The Need"){: width="250" height="284" loading="lazy"}<br>Wednesday, Oct. 15 is the beginning of the second annual Feed The Need Campus Food Drive.

This initiative is to collect non-perishable food items to support students who are facing food insecurity. Your contributions can make a significant impact on their lives.

**Drop-off Locations on KCC's Riverfront Campus:**

* Near the Student Life Office (Room L116)
* Public Safety Desk
* Outside of the Food Pantry (Room D321)

Please join others at KCC in this effort. Every donation counts. Your support helps create a caring community where everyone feels valued and supported.

The final day for collections is Dec. 1.

According to recent studies, as many as 39% of community college students nationally face food insecurity, highlighting the importance of initiatives like Feed the Need. By working together, Illinois community colleges are demonstrating their commitment to student well-being and to the communities they call home.

This statewide initiative, organized by the Illinois Community College Board, engages campuses in a friendly competition while serving a critical need. Last year, Illinois community colleges collectively donated more than 91,000 food items to support students and families across the state.
