KCC’s Placement Testing Center in Room D218 has current hours posted on the placement testing webpage, [Location & Hours tab](https://www.kcc.edu/admissions/testing/#location-and-hours).

For students who need to test at a specific time, it’s recommended that you make an appointment by emailing [testingcenter@kcc.edu](mailto:testingcenter@kcc.edu). It is also helpful for students to plan for enough time to complete exams before the Testing Center closes. To complete a make-up exam for a course, allow for the time the professor indicates. For placement testing, allow one hour for ACCUPLACER and one hour for ALEKS.

New signage will also be on the Placement Testing Center door (Room D218) with a link to the online calendar and QR code to scan for [current hours](https://www.kcc.edu/admissions/testing/#location-and-hours).
