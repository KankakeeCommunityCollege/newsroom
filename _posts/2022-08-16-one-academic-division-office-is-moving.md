Effective Sept. 6, 2022, all of KCC's academic division offices will be in one location: Room W102.

![](/uploads/2022/small-graphic-w102-location300x312.jpg){: .float-image-right width="300" height="312"}Room W102 is on the first floor, in the Prairie Building (between Health Careers and the Technology and Innovation Center). See graphic or this [PDF of the first floor](/uploads/2022/First-floor-5-22-highlightW102.pdf){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} .

The academic divisions are:

* Business, Technology & Human Services
* Health Careers
* Humanities and Social Sciences

Two division offices are already in Room W102: Business, Technology & Human Services and Health Careers. Beginning Sept. 6, they will be joined by &nbsp;Humanities and Social Sciencesâ€“which is moving from Room L355.

Typical reasons students visit the division office are for schedule requests, general information about a program or help in communicating with a faculty member.
