The KCC community is invited to contribute video messages to share with veterans during the 2019 Veterans’ Recognition Ceremony.

To participate, come and record a brief video thank you during one of the following sessions at the atrium area (inside the main entrance, near the Miner Memorial Library):

* Tuesday, Oct. 1, 2:30-3 p.m.
* Wednesday, Oct. 2, 9-10 a.m.
* Thursday, Oct. 3, 11 a.m. - noon

Students, faculty and staff are invited to participate. Each person will be asked to record a quick *thank you* to veterans, with the option to include an additional personal note (how veterans have impacted your life, for example).

All recorded segments will be compiled into one video – so individual recordings may be edited for length or content. The finished product will be shown during the Veterans’ Recognition Ceremony at 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday, Nov. 6 at in KCC’s auditorium. All members of the community are also invited to that event.

Anyone with questions is invited to contact [Kendra Souligne](mailto:ksouligne@kcc.edu), co-advisor of the KCC Veterans Association.
