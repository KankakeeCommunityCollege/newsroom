We're thrilled to announce that 10 of our KCC students have transferred through the DDP program to GOVST in the 2023 Fall semester. A big applause to Thomas Daily, Laretta Graves, Kelsie Hiatt, Zierra Hill, Edward Horathm, Heather Keene, Rodolfo Leal, Vanessa Moss, Andrew Snider, and Arika Stanley.
