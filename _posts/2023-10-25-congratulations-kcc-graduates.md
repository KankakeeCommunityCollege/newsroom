It was a heartwarming event celebrating the hard work and dedication of DDP students who completed their associate degrees at community colleges and transferred to Governors State University.![KCC graduate Arika Stanley at GSU Cording Ceremony](blob:https://app.cloudcannon.com/a45ec30f-6935-46a6-b445-b338e778b712 "KCC graduate Arika Stanley at GSU Cording Ceremony"){: .float-image-right width="250" height="361"}

We're thrilled to announce that 10 of our KCC students have transferred through the DDP program to GOVST in the 2023 Fall semester. A big applause to Thomas Daily, Laretta Graves, Kelsie Hiatt, Zierra Hill, Edward Horathm, Heather Keene, Rodolfo Leal, Vanessa Moss, Andrew Snider, and Arika Stanley. We couldn't be prouder of them! And let's not forget to congratulate our very own Thomas, Heather, and Rodolfo, who were recipients of the DDP ![KCC graduate Thomas Daily at GSU Cording Ceremony](blob:https://app.cloudcannon.com/0b2575e9-5c55-42e5-96c8-3b58ce8f6e48 "KCC graduate Thomas Daily at GSU Cording Ceremony"){: .float-image-left width="250" height="350"}Scholarships.
