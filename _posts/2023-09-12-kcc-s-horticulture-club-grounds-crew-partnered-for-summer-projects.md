This summer the KCC Horticulture Club and Grounds Crew partnered to beautify the ![Plant identification tags on Kankakee Community College Riverfront Campus](/uploads/2023/hortclub-350x240.jpg "Plant identification tags on Kankakee Community College Riverfront Campus"){: .float-image-left}Riverfront Campus one project at a time!

Have you seen the plant identification tags around campus? At the beginning of summer, the Hort Club made plant identification tags to be placed by the Grounds Crew in landscapes around campus. With these tags, visitors can learn the botanical names and common names of the plant material beautifying campus.![Tree nursery sign at Kankakee Community College Riverfront Campus](/uploads/2023/hortclub-350x253.jpg "Tree nursery sign at Kankakee Community College Riverfront Campus"){: .float-image-right}

Did you know the 3-hole golf course is also home to KCCâ€™s Tree Nursery? The tree nursery was established by the Hort Club and grounds crew, and is home to young saplings. The saplings are protected in the tree nursery until they are established and ready to be transplanted elsewhere on campus. The nursery sign is readable from College ![Decorative planter at Kankakee Community College Riverfront Campus](/uploads/2023/hortclub-200x283.jpg "Decorative planter at Kankakee Community College Riverfront Campus"){: .float-image-left}Drive.

Did you know there are over 20 decorative planters on the Riverfront Campus? The grounds crew brought most of the planters to the West Campus Greenhouse and the Hort Club planted them. Some of the plant material in the planters are canna, geraniums, sweet potato vine, and vinca. The Hort Club has been busy all summer maintaining the pots.

Have you seen the new interiorscape design in the lower![Hort Club officers Dakota Donaldson and Sophia Steelman-Teach pose with interiorscape at Kankakee Community College Riverfront Campus](/uploads/2023/hortclub-200x333.jpg "Hort Club officers Dakota Donaldson and Sophia Steelman-Teach pose with interiorscape at Kankakee Community College Riverfront Campus"){: .float-image-right} level of the College Center? The wood planters were made and installed by the grounds crew. The design, plant material, rocks and mulch were installed by Hort Club officers Dakota Donaldson and Sophia Steelman-Teach. The interiorscape will be maintained by the Hort Club.
