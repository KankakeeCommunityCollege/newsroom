The following message was sent by email to all KCC students on Oct. 4:

Beginning Monday, Oct. 11, free COVID-19 testing will be offered on KCC’s Riverfront Campus in Kankakee as a convenience to students. The tests are offered through Loop Medical Center and are PCR tests.&nbsp;

Appointments are required. You can make appointments and access your results through Loop Medical Center’s secure and HIPPA-approved web portal. More information regarding registration and how to access the portal will be sent to your KCC student email on Wednesday, Oct. 6.

The weekly test schedule is:&nbsp;<br>Mondays: 7 a.m. - 7 p.m.<br>Tuesdays: 7 a.m. - 7 p.m.<br>Wednesdays: 7 a.m. - 1 p.m.

If you are curious about the test, or want to see a preview of the testing process, representatives from Loop Medical Center will be available Friday, Oct. 8 from 9-11 a.m. in the Cavalier Room at KCC.&nbsp;

Illinois’ Governor requires higher education students who are on campus regularly to either be vaccinated against COVID-19 or to complete a weekly COVID-19 test. The college will follow prescribed measures to ensure the order is followed.&nbsp;

You can avoid weekly tests if you are vaccinated. Already vaccinated? Please provide your [proof of vaccination](https://form.jotform.com/212384579044965){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} if you have not already done so.
