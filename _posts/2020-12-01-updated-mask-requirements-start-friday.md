Following guidance from the CDC (Centers for Disease Control), the Governor’s office and the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH), KCC is revising the campus mask requirement. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Beginning Friday, June 11, fully vaccinated individuals will no longer be required to wear a mask while on campus. This flexibility does not extend to unvaccinated individuals, who should continue to wear a mask while on campus.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>This change is consistent with the latest science that indicates that the COVID-19 vaccine provides effective protection against the virus and allows those vaccinated to remove their masks in most settings.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The college will depend on the integrity of our students and colleagues to wear a mask—or not—based on your individual vaccine status and personal choice.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>If you have not already done so, we strongly suggest that you make a plan to receive a vaccine, for both your health and the flexibility it now provides while you’re on campus and in the community.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Thank you for your continued partnership as we continue to take steps toward a full campus reopening. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
