Regina VanDeVelde, clinical education coordinator for the Physical Therapist Assistant program at KCC, recently presented a research poster at a conference hosted by the Acute Care Section of the American Physical Therapy Association.

VanDeVelde conducted the research in collaboration with Governors State University in University Park.

The information VanDeVelde (far right in the photo) shared is about the intra-professional relationship between physical therapist and physical therapist assistant students in the clinical setting.

It's full title is "Inpatient interprofessional clinical experience lends to increased knowledge and awareness of the PT:PTA role."

KCC offers an [Associate Degree in Physical Therapist Assistant](https://kcc.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2024-2025/academic-catalog/programs/physical-therapist-assistant-aas/ "KCC Physical Therapist Assistant program"){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. It is a competitive entry program, with a maximum of 20 students entering it each fall. The five-semester program integrates professional standards, theory and clinical education in a variety of physical therapy settings. Students progress through the program as a cohort group.

Graduates are prepared for employment as entry-level physical therapist assistants who work under the direction and supervision of a physical therapist. Employment settings for physical therapist assistants include hospitals, outpatient clinics, rehabilitation centers, nursing homes, home health, hospice facilities, school districts, and research centers.
