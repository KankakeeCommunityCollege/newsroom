The [Capital Development Board](https://cdb.illinois.gov/) is holding a free informational outreach session at Kankakee Community College on Wednesday, June 26 from 9:30 a.m. - noon.

The event is for local contractors and businesses to learn more about opportunities available through government construction contracts. It includes information on pre-qualifying as a government contractor; how to bid on CDB projects; and what qualifies a business for diversity certification as Minority Business Enterprise, Women Business Enterprise, Veteran Business Enterprise and Persons with Disability Business Enterprise.

In addition to construction businesses, the CDB recommends the session to purchasing officers from school districts and municipalities.

Although the event is free, participants are asked to register at [bit.ly/3ygKqd5](https://bit.ly/3ygKqd5). The session will be in KCCâ€™s Advanced Technology Education Center, Room T205. KCC is located at 100 College Drive in Kankakee.

The CDB is a state agency responsible for overseeing the construction of state-owned buildings. It allocates approximately $1.2 billion annually across roughly 700 projects.
