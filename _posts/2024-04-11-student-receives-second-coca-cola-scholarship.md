For the second time, Allie Kohl of Herscher has been selected to receive a Coca-Cola academic scholarship.

In 2023, Kohl received a $1,000 Coca-Cola Leaders of Promise scholarship. This year, she has earned $1,500 as a Gold Scholar on Coca-Cola’s 2024 Academic Team. The award stems from Kohl’s score in the All-USA Academic Team competition.

Kohl is an Early College program student at Kankakee Community College. She is taking KCC courses during her junior and senior years at Herscher High School. In May, Kohl will graduate from both KCC and high school. At KCC, Kohl is taking general education courses. She [plans to transfer to Olivet Nazarene University in Bourbonnais to study social work.]()

“Allie’s drive for academic success at such a young age is inspiring,” said Jaclyn Montemayer, co-advisor for KCC’s chapter of Phi Theta Kappa, the international honor society for community college students. Kohl is president of the chapter.

“I am highly honored to have been awarded a second Coca-Cola academic scholarship,” Kohl said. “To be named a Gold Scholar on Coca-Cola’s 2024 Academic Team is an accomplishment I am immensely proud of. It's moments like these that reaffirm the significance of my hard work and keep me committed to continuing my academic journey with passion and determination.”

Out of 2,200 applicants, only 50 were chosen as Gold Scholars. Fifty Silver Scholars and 50 Bronze Scholars were also chosen. They received scholarships of $1,250 and $1,000, respectively.

In addition to being president of [KCC’s chapter of Phi Theta Kappa](https://www.kcc.edu/student-resources/student-life/clubs/#phi-theta-kappa), Kohl is also president of [KCC’s Psychology Club](https://www.kcc.edu/student-resources/student-life/clubs/#psychology-club).

Kohl is a member of the Kankakee County Swine Youth Team and Cabery Specials 4-H Club. She also volunteers with Clove Alliance and Harbor House.

“The Coca-Cola Academic Team recognizes high achieving college students who demonstrate academic excellence and intellectual rigor combined with leadership and service that extends their education beyond the classroom to benefit society,” according to online information from [Phi Theta Kappa](https://www.ptk.org/scholarships/how-our-scholarships-work/).
