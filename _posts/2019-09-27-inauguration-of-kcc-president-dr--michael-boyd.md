A reception will follow the ceremony. The community is invited to the inauguration and celebration.&nbsp;

An academic procession, KCC's ceremonial mace and chains-of-office medallion will be a part of the ceremony. Remarks will be made by representatives from KCC’s Board of Trustees, student body, faculty, alumni and workforce partners. Dr. Boyd will also deliver an inaugural address. Music will be provided by the Manteno High School concert band.

“This is the first time KCC will host an inauguration, and we are excited to incorporate this important academic ritual into our culture and history,” said Kari Nugent, director of Marketing and Public Relations. “An academic ceremony like this one reinforces that academics are a priority. We hope that you will join us.”<br>&nbsp;
