![Kankakee Community College Fast Path program](/uploads/2023/fastpathlogo-300x250.jpg "Kankakee Community College Fast Path program"){: .float-image-left width="300" height="250"}The Fast Path Program uses a set schedule of two classes a week for students to earn an associate in arts transfer degree in two years in Watseka. New classes begin every eight weeks. The course sequence is prearranged, taking the uncertainty out of scheduling.

“The 7<sup>th</sup> group of Fast Path students will begin classes this fall,” said Nancy Schunke, the fast path adviser at the South Extension Center.&nbsp; “Fast Path students have a support system they can rely on. We mentor, guide and coach each student and give them the tools they need to be successful, including a new laptop.”

“Fast Path allows me to pursue my associate![KCC Fast Path students Ben Storm and Mason Conrad](/uploads/2023/fastpath-350x327.jpg "KCC Fast Path students Ben Storm and Mason Conrad"){: .float-image-right width="350" height="327"} degree in a timely fashion,” said Ben Storm, a current program student. “It also made it easy to adjust to college.”

The program admits a maximum of 20 students each fall.

“I was uncertain about my future plans and the Fast Path staff helped me set goals so I could get started on my career path,” said Mason Conrad, who is also a current Fast Path student. “I feel very catered to.”

Applications are now being accepted, and classes begin in August.
