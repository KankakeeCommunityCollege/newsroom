For Fall 2022, Kankakee Community College is resuming GED&reg; and HiSET&reg; high school equivalency preparation classes in Bradley and Watseka.

![KCC GED graduate](/uploads/2022/gedclasses-250x376.jpg "KCC GED graduate"){: .float-image-left width="250" height="376"}The free GED and HiSET classes are offered at four sites: the KCC Riverfront Campus, the KCC North Extension Center in Bradley, the KCC South Extension Center in Watseka, and online. Course locations had been limited due to COVID-19. All options are available again this fall.

A KCC application, available at [apply.kcc.edu](http://apply.kcc.edu), is required before enrollment. After an application is received, the program coordinator contacts applicants personally to make arrangements to attend the next available session.

The next classes begin the week of Oct. 17 at all locations. There is no cost to the student.

Classes are designed for students at least 16 years of age who have not completed high school and are not enrolled in the school system. KCC offers the classes as preparation for the GED and HiSET. The college also offers a GED practice test.

Course locations and meeting times are:![KCC GED graduates](/uploads/2022/gedclasses-350x313.jpg "KCC GED graduates"){: .float-image-right width="350" height="233"}
