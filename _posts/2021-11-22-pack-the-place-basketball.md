Cheer on the Cavaliers at Pack the Place games Tuesday, Nov. 30 beginning at 5:30 p.m. with the Lady Cavaliers and 7:30 p.m. with the men's team in the Ryan Gymnasium.

Wear your “Scarlet Fever” T-shirt, show your school pride and support our Cavaliers as they compete against Oakton Community College.
