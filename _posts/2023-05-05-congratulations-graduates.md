Emerson completed an Associate in Science in December 2022, and has completed a semester at Eastern Illinois University, where he is studying environmental biology.![Laretta Graves, 2023 KCC graduate](/uploads/2022/laretta-graves300x200.jpg "Laretta Graves, 2023 KCC graduate"){: .float-image-right width="300" height="200"}

“I just turned 50 last year, and to finally be graduating from college is a dream come true,” said Laretta Graves, who will receive an Associate in Arts transfer degree.

“This has been one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of my life,” Graves said. “I plan to continue with my goals and dreams by attending GSU (Governors State University) in the fall, majoring in pre-clinical psychology with a minor in philosophy. I will miss KCC, though, as it has become a place where I have further empowered myself and grown. Here's to 50 more years!”![Noah Stack, 2023 KCC graduate](/uploads/2022/noah-stack250x313.jpg "Noah Stack, 2023 KCC graduate"){: .float-image-right width="250" height="313"}

Stack will receive an Associate in Applied Science degree in Agri-Hort Technology. He is going to move to California and attend a ministry school.

“This has been a long journey for me,” said Adlene Noble of Kankakee. “These last couple of years, I took the initiative to focus and get the last few classes I needed![Eric Peterson, 2023 KCC commencement speaker](/uploads/2022/eric-peterson-grad-speaker-2023-250x313.jpg "Eric Peterson, 2023 KCC commencement speaker"){: .float-image-right width="250" height="313"} done to obtain my associate’s degree.

“I am a first-generation graduate,” said Noble. “I’m so proud of myself for this accomplishment.”

After receiving an Associate in General Studies degree, Noble plans to continue at KCC, first by applying to the Licensed Practical Nursing program, and eventually completing the Registered Nursing ![Julie Anco, 2023 Illinois All-Academic Team member](/uploads/2022/julie-anco250x313.jpg "Julie Anco, 2023 Illinois All-Academic Team member"){: .float-image-left width="250" height="313"}degree.

In her words: Meghann Rosemary Miller![Dana Corlett-Bryant, 2023 KCC Outstanding Faculty Winner](/uploads/2022/dana-corlett-bryant250x331.jpg "Dana Corlett-Bryant, 2023 KCC Outstanding Faculty Winner"){: .float-image-right width="250" height="331"}<br>Associate in Arts transfer degree

“I began this journey after high school in 2003, with a class here and there. I have taken several breaks. In 2016, I decided to begin again, this time I became pregnant with my first born and through a rough pregnancy I managed my first semester. My husband received his degree from KCC 2016. One of my first classes back was one of his last. Restarting the journey with him pushed me to follow through. I slowly went through courses while working full-time and being a new mom. I was set to graduate in 2020 when I had to take a medical leave when I became pregnant with my second child. He was born in 2020 during the lockdown. After two years, I decided to go back to work, ![Meghann Miller, 2023 KCC graduate](/uploads/2022/meghann-miller250x313.jpg "Meghann Miller, 2023 KCC graduate"){: .float-image-left width="250" height="313"}and they actually encouraged me to go back to school. I realized that after those two classes, I really only![Tocarra Eldridge-Robinson, 2023 KCC John M.

Fulton Distinguished Alumni Award Winner"){: .float-image-right width="250" height="313"} needed one more to graduate. So finally, after 20 years, I have a degree and can make my children proud and let them know to never give up and with enough dedication and hard work anything is possible.”

Miller’s two children are now ages 3 and 6. They participate in organized sports and other activities. She is going to take a break from college, and plans to pursue a bachelor’s degree once they are in school.
