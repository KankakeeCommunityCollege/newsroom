Following guidance from the [Centers for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, the [governor’s office](https://www.illinoispolicy.org/illinois-reopens-june-11-but-keeps-those-masks-handy/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and the [Illinois Department of Public Health](https://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19/community-guidance/recommendations-fully-vaccinated){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, KCC is revising its mask requirement.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Beginning Friday, June 11, individuals who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 will no longer be required to wear a mask while at college facilities, both indoors and outside. This adjustment follows announcements from the CDC and IDPH which indicate that the COVID-19 vaccine provides effective protection against the virus. Therefore, those vaccinated can remove their masks in most settings.&nbsp;

This change does not extend to unvaccinated individuals, who should [continue to wear a mask](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} while on college property.&nbsp;

KCC will depend on the integrity of students and staff to follow the requirements based on their individual vaccine status.&nbsp;

For those who have not done so already, the college also recommends [getting a COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} – for both the health benefits and the flexibility it now provides while at the college and in the community.

Please note: Also on June 11, the requirement to complete a self-assessment before entering a KCC facility is being removed for everyone.
