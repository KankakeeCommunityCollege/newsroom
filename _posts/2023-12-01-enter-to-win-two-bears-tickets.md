The KCC Veterans Association is raffling off two tickets to the Bears vs. Cardinals game on Christmas Eve!&nbsp;

Tickets are $4 each, or 3 for $10. All proceeds will help send our club members to the Student Veteran Association National Conference in January 2024.

Tickets will be sold in the College Center on Monday, December 4th from 11 a.m. â€“ 1:00 p.m., or will be available for purchase from Megan Ponton in Room L205. She can be reached at [mponton@kcc.edu](mailto:mponton@kcc.edu) or (815) 802-8553 for any questions. The winner will be drawn on Thursday, December 14th!
