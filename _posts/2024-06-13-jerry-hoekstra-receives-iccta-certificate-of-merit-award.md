“Mr. Hoekstra's receipt of this award is a reflection of his career-long dedication to the community college system and his impactful contributions to Kankakee Community College,” said Dr. Michael Boyd, president of KCC. “Jerry’s commitment to enhancing educational opportunities and his support for critical developments at KCC have made an impact for KCC and the community we serve. This award is a testament to his remarkable contributions and the lasting legacy he leaves behind."
