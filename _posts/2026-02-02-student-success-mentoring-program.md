The Student Success Mentoring Program application is now available for the Spring 2026 term.

The program is designed to empower students through meaningful mentorship connections.

“This program is more than just guidance, it’s about building relationships that inspire students to persist, thrive, and graduate,” said Melany Villagomez, KCC’s coordinator of equity, diversity and inclusion.

Regular student-mentor connections foster academic success, leadership, and personal development.

“Research shows that students with mentors are more likely to stay in school, perform better academically, and feel a stronger sense of belonging,” Villagomez said. “At KCC, we believe that every student deserves a champion, and this program is hoping to make that happen.”
