Kankakee Community College honored Roy Cordes, affectionately known as *The Voice of the Cavaliers*, at a retirement reception on April 28. Cordes has served as the college’s sports announcer since 2008, lending his enthusiastic voice to KCC athletics for over 15 years.

“Roy’s voice has become a signature part of the KCC athletic experience,” said Bryce Shafer, KCC’s Director of Athletics. “His energy, passion, and genuine love for Cavalier sports have elevated the game-day atmosphere for our teams and fans alike. We’re grateful for his years of service and proud to celebrate his legacy.”

Throughout his time at the microphone, Cordes brought life to many athletic events, including historic matchups like the men’s basketball team’s 101–85 victory over Triton College in January 2024 and the baseball team’s win over Madison in 2017 that sent them to the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) World Series. He was also on hand to call the action during several of KCC’s national title runs, including the 2015 softball season that led to the national title, and the 2017 baseball national championship season.
