Registration is underway for Kankakee Community College’s fall semester courses.

“The staff, professors, and faculty are extremely warm and helpful,” said Guadalupe Martinez of Kankakee. “Campus is easy to navigate, and finding classrooms is easy. Not only that, but the cost is a big advantage of KCC.”

Martinez, a 2024 KCC graduate, is transferring to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to major in psychology.

There are two general paths for KCC students: transfer and career/technical education. Transfer students enroll in programs and courses which lead to a four-year college/university degree. Career/technical students have multiple options which lead to certifications, degrees and employment.

New students can start by submitting an application at [https://apply.kcc.edu](https://apply.kcc.edu/?utm_medium=pr&amp;utm_campaign=regist-fa2024). After applying, new students meet with a KCC academic advisor and finish the registration process.

Returning students can use the My KCC portal at [https://my.kcc.edu](https://my.kcc.edu/?utm_medium=pr&amp;utm_campaign=regist-fa2024) and go to the “Self-Service” link to register. In addition, registration and advising appointments for returning students are available at [www.kcc.edu/student-resources/advising](https://www.kcc.edu/student-resources/advising?utm_medium=pr&amp;utm_campaign=regist-fa2024).

All students are encouraged to register early for the best selection of classes.

“The advice I would give someone at KCC is get to know the staff and don’t be afraid to ask for assistance because they would gladly help a student with anything they can,” said Robert Billings of Kankakee. “Get into some activities and make a group of friends to feel like you belong and are a part of the community of KCC.” Billings completed a KCC transfer degree in December 2023.

College offices will be closed June 28, July 4, 12, 19 and 26.

KCC’s Riverfront Campus in Kankakee is located at 100 College Drive, south of downtown Kankakee.

Students also can register and meet with advisers at the KCC South Extension Center, 1488 E. Walnut St. in Watseka, next to the Watseka Riverside Medical Center facility. Extension center advising hours are Tuesday and Thursday, 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. and other times by appointment. The phone number is 815-802-8270.
