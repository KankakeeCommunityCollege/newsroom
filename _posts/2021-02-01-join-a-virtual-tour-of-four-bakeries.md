The [Continuing Education Department](http://continuinged.kcc.edu){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} at Kankakee Community College is offering a unique virtual tour featuring bakery items to sample at the stops along the way.

* Half-pound box from Peter Sciortino's Bakery, from historic Brady Street in Milwaukee.
* Mini Three King's Cake from female-owned La Flor de Trigo.
* A dozen of National Bakery's famous pecan fingers.
* Six Madeleines from Greige Patisserie.
* Plus, Ultimate Confections hand-dipped chocolates.

The box has enough to share with a friend or a date. Everyone will get to enjoy a number of delectable tastes, sights and sounds during the tour.”

The cost is $79, and includes a box of pastries and chocolates large enough to share, and the educational seminar/virtual tour. Deadline to register is Feb. 22.
