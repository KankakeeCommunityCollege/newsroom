“It is important to complete a FAFSA as soon as possible after it becomes available Oct. 1,” said Michelle Hasik, KCC director of financial aid. “It does not matter if you have chosen a college or university, or even if the student will attend college. Completing the FAFSA early provides a safety net so when plans are finalized it is not too late to receive grants, student loans and scholarships.”

KCC also offers a series of [Free FAFSA workshops](http://www.kcc.edu/future/paying/fedstateaid/Pages/fafsa-scholarship-workshops.aspx)&nbsp;to help fill out the forms.
