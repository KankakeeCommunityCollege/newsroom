Kankakee Community College’s nursing programs have received two pieces of ![](/uploads/colin-lamie-health-simulation-dsc-9425.jpg){: .float-image-right width="200" height="194"}good news.

The college’s Registered Nursing program achieved a 96% pass rate on the 2020 NCLEX-RN (National Council of Licensure Exams) exam.

Our students worked very hard under extraordinary conditions. They didn’t give up. While we finished the spring semester using online and other remote learning solutions, faculty went above and beyond to be available to students.

“This is a true bright spot during a pandemic that has impacted the nursing profession so deeply.”

KCC’s two-year [registered nursing program](http://kcc.smartcatalogiq.com/current/Academic-Catalog/Programs-of-Study-by-Area/Health-Careers/Nursing-Registered-AAS) accepts new students each fall and spring semester. It incorporates classroom lectures, clinical experiences and lab demonstrations. The program is designed to prepare students for work in hospital departments, as well as in long-term care, home care, business and industry, outpatient clinics, public agencies, and physicians’ offices.

The college also learned that its Licensed Practical Nursing advanced certificate program has been ranked fourth in Illinois by [practicalnursing.org](https://www.practicalnursing.org/).

“We are very proud that the program has been in the top five in the state for the past three years,” Hayes said. “Graduates put in a lot of effort and were ready for the NCLEX. As always, our faculty did a great job making sure they were preparing and delivering a curriculum which meets current needs.”

The [ranking](https://www.practicalnursing.org/lpn-programs/illinois#rankings) is based on five years, from 2015-19, of NCLEX-PN (National Council of Licensure Exams) pass rates. The list includes community college and diploma programs. There are 34 ranked programs, and 18 of the top 20 colleges on the list are community colleges.

KCC’s pass rate on the NCLEX-PN exam for 2019 was 100 percent. The practical nursing program has had a 100 percent pass rate for the past seven years. The first through third ranked colleges are higher on the list because they had more graduates than KCC.

At KCC, [Licensed Practical Nursing](http://kcc.smartcatalogiq.com/current/Academic-Catalog/Programs-of-Study-by-Area/Health-Careers/Nursing-Practical-Advanced-Certificate) is a one-year program which prepares students for immediate entry into the workforce. At KCC, students take the [NCLEX-PN exam](https://www.ncsbn.org/nclex.htm) upon completion of the advanced certificate in practical nursing.

The LPN program has a competitive entry process, and accepts new students each fall. It incorporates classroom lectures, clinical experiences and lab demonstrations. The program is designed to prepare students for work in long-term care, business and industry, outpatient clinics, public agencies, and physicians’ offices.

LPNs also can apply for advanced placement into KCC’s registered nursing program.

Both KCC’s Licensed Practical Nursing and Registered Nursing programs are accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing.&nbsp; Accredited programs must meet or exceed standards and criteria for educational quality as determined by the ACEN. In Illinois there are eight LPN programs accredited by ACEN, and 32 associate degree programs they have accredited.
