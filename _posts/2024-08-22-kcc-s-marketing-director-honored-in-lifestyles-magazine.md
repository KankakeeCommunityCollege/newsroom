Schmidt has worked in KCC’s marketing department since 1992. She is an active member of the Kankakee County Chamber of Commerce Women in Networking committee, which fosters connections and empowers women in the local business community. Schmidt also volunteers for the B. Harley Bradley House and is a regular blood donor.

“Ellen has always been deeply committed to the success and well-being of our community, our students, and her coworkers, and this is a well-deserved honor,” said Kari Nugent, vice president for Advancement, Marketing and Public Relations. “She consistently puts others first and sets an example of excellence in everything she does. Whether it’s her work at KCC or her involvement in local initiatives, Ellen’s dedication and passion inspire those around her.”

“There are many good things going on in our area, and I’m proud to be part of it,” Schmidt said. “KCC contributes a lot to positive change throughout the area, and it is an honor to tell people about the college and what it offers.”

This is the sixth year that Lifestyles has published the Women in Business series. The other honorees for 2024 are Jolene Boothe, Nicole Gavin, Gloria Kennedy, Jennifer Kokos, Ashley Landers, Dawn Willbarger and Kelly Winterroth.

The 2024 “Women in Business” honorees were celebrated at a luncheon on Aug. 22 at the Kankakee Country Club.
