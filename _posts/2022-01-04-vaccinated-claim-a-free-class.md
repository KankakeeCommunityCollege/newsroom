![](/uploads/free-class-if-vaccinated-news-272x272.jpg){: .float-image-right width="272" height="272"}KCC is offering a free class during Spring 2022 to anyone who brings in their vaccination card and student ID, as long as they didn't receive the incentive last fall.&nbsp;

The free class is offered as a tuition credit at the time of registration. The maximum value is $495. The offer applies only to tuition and basic fees of $165 per credit hour. Additional fees (including lab fees, out-of-district fees and others) are not included. The college will not give any cash back, and it is offered to people who come in-person only.

There is a limit of one free class per student. So, any student who received the free class in Fall 2021 is not eligible anymore.

To redeem, the student must show their own original COVID-19 vaccination card and KCC student ID card at KCC's payment counter. Electronic copies and duplicates are not accepted.

Students who have already registered and paid can follow the procedures above to receive a refund check.

The free class for vaccinated individuals is available only for KCC students enrolled in a credit class or developmental education class for the Spring 2022 semester. Dual credit, non-credit continuing education, adult education, and English as a Second Language classes are excluded. Employees and their dependents are also excluded.

The offer expires May 1, 2022.

The college is paying for the incentive using funds from the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund.

For more information about the free class incentive, email or phone the college's Accounting Office at [accountingoffice@kcc.edu](mailto:accountingoffice@kcc.edu) or phone 815-802-8140.

KCC has other sources of funds for Spring 2022 enrollment detailed in another news article titled "[Spring 2022 funds for students](https://news.kcc.edu/2021/12/17/spring-2022-funds-for-students.html)."
