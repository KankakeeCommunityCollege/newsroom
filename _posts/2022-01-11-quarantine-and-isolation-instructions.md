Students, employees and visitors who have tested positive for COVID-19, or who have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, are instructed to following the&nbsp;[Center for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}&nbsp;quarantine and isolation instructions.

**If you are exposed to someone with COVID-19**

The need to quarantine [depends on your vaccination status](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. All those who are exposed should:

* Get tested for COVID-19 at least 5 days after your last had close contact with someone with COVID-19.
* Watch for symptoms until 10 days after you last had close contact with someone with COVID-19. Isolate immediately and get tested if you develop symptoms.
* Take precautions for 10 days (wear a mask anytime you are around others, avoid travel, avoid being around people who are at high risk).

**If you test positive for COVID-19 or have symptoms**

* Isolate for 5 days after onset of symptoms, or 5 days from specimen collection date if no symptoms are present.
  * Day 0 is the first day of symptoms or specimen collection date if asymptomatic.
  * If you continue to have fever or other symptoms, or have not improved after 5 days of isolation, do not end isolation until you are fever-free for 24 hours and your other symptoms have improved.&nbsp;
* Continue to wear a well-fitted mask around others for 5 additional days after release from isolation. If unable to wear a mask when around others, continue to isolate for a total of 10 days.&nbsp;
  * Avoid being around students or staff who are immunocompromised or at high risk for severe disease.&nbsp;
  * If masks need to be removed (e.g., for lunch), ensure 6 feet of physical distancing until 10 days after symptom onset or positive test.&nbsp;
