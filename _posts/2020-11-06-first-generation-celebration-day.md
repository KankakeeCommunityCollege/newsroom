In honor of [First-Generation Celebration Day Nov. 8](https://firstgen.naspa.org/engagement/first-generation-college-celebration/first-generation-college-celebration){: target="_blank"}, Kankakee Community College is sharing information about the [TRIO Student Support Services](http://www.kcc.edu/students/helpful/trio/Pages/default.aspx){: target="_blank"} program.

![](/uploads/trio-sss.JPG){: .float-image-right width="348" height="104"}TRIO Student Support Services is an academic support program for students who are first-generation, income-eligible or disabled and plan to transfer to a 4-year college/university to pursue their baccalaureate degree.

A first-generation college student is someone whose parent(s)/legal guardian(s) have not completed a bachelor's degree.&nbsp;

“TRIO Student Support Services advisors help students research their chosen major at four-year institutions and help them select courses at KCC that align with that major,” said Keisha Smith, KCC’s director of TRIO Student Support Services. “TRIO students follow an academic plan, which is called a Life Map, because it helps the student balance school, work, family and other things in life that impact student success.”&nbsp;

The program is funded by a grant from the U.S. Department of Education, so all of TRIO’s services are free. Those services include:

* Transportation to 4-year colleges/universities for campus visits
* Career coaching
* Financial literacy information
* Cultural field trips
* Workshops to enhance college success skills
* Transfer assistance with admissions applications, scholarships and housing; and
* A student center with computers, printers and a comfortable place to study.
