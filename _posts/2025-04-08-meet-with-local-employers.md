Kankakee Community College will host a Spring Job Fair on Thursday, April 17 from 10 a.m. - 2 p.m. in the KCC College Center.

The event is open to the public and veterans are encouraged to attend. Admission is free to all. Employers will conduct on site pre-screening interviews for both full and part-time positions.

“The job fair is to bridge the gap between local employers and job seekers,” said Cesar Avalos, coordinator of workforce opportunities at KCC. “We want to enhance job seekers’ experiences by providing them the opportunity to meet and talk with representative from a broad spectrum of companies to discuss available positions and personally submit their résumé to recruiters.”

More than 60 employers are expected to attend. KCC’s Career Services Center offers resume assistance before the job fair.

An employer registration form and list of participating employers is at [www.kcc.edu/jobfair](www.kcc.edu/jobfair "KCC Spring Job Fair"){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

KCC is located at 100 College Drive in Kankakee, south of downtown Kankakee.

The Job Fair is sponsored by KCC’s Charlton Family Foundation Career Services Center.
