As winter approaches, KCC wants to share the current Center for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines regarding COVID.

This information is being shared in hopes that it helps answer frequent questions about COVID and time away from the classroom.&nbsp;

* **How long must I stay home if I have COVID?**&nbsp;
  * Please stay home for at least 5 days and isolate from others in your home. You are likely most infectious during these first 5 days.
* **What do I do about my classes if I have tested positive for COVID?**
  * Contact your instructors immediately if you have tested positive for COVID. Your instructor will work with you regarding your absences from class. Please remember, each instructor may have a different attendance policy. It's up to you to communicate with your instructor(s) and to understand what accommodations are being made for each class. &nbsp;&nbsp;
* **Do I have to wear a mask upon returning to school?**
  * Yes, the CDC recommends that someone returning to classes after having COVID should wear a mask for the next 5 days.&nbsp;
* **What should I do if I have been exposed to someone who tested positive for COVID?**
  * Wear a high-quality mask for 10 days after having close contact with someone with COVID.
  * Get tested at least 5 days after you had last close contact with someone with COVID, even if you don't have any symptoms.
  * Stay home until you know the results.
  * Watch for symptoms through 10 days after you last had close contact with someone with COVID.
  * If you develop symptoms, isolate immediately and get tested.
* **Can I get free COVID tests mailed to my home?**
  * Yes, every U.S. household can place an order to receive four (4) COVID rapid tests delivered to your home. You can order online at [www.covid.gov/tests](https://www.covid.gov/tests){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, or call 1-800-232-0233. &nbsp;
