The elevator inside of the KCC Miner Memorial Library is out of order.

Unfortunately, the broken part cannot be replaced quickly. So, there is no timeline for when it will be back in service.&nbsp;

We apologize for the inconvenience.

If more updates or a timeframe becomes available, that information will be added here.
