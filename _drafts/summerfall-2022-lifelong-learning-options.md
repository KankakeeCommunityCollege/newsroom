The Lifelong Learning Institute offers affordable, high-quality, non-credit classes that take place in an environment that fosters participation. These video lectures are pre-recorded and played during the class session. These classes are open to people ages 50 and older. Sessions vary from a few hours to several meetings. Prices also vary, and many of the classes are $20 or less. &nbsp;&nbsp;
