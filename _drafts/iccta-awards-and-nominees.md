Kankakee Community College has nominated a longtime business partner, student, graduate and current board member for awards given by the Illinois Community College Trustees Association.

**![](/uploads/nucor-signingdsc-3652-250x167.jpg){: .float-image-left width="250" height="167"}Nucor Steel** was nominated for the Business/Industry Partnership Award, which recognizes an Illinois business that has built a successful workforce-training alliance with an ICCTA member college.

"We are honored to learn that KCC is nominating Nucor Steel Kankakee , Inc for the Illinois Community College Trustees Association 2021 Business Industry Partnership Award," said Kevin Van de Ven, vice president and general manager of Nucor Steel in&nbsp; Kankakee. "Put most simply, the academic and workforce training programs offered at KCC are an essential part of Nucor's past achievements and future success."

Nucor has assisted in the growth and development of course content and task breakdowns in many electrical, welding, fabrication, manufacturing and computer design courses at KCC, said Paul Carlson, dean of business, technology and human services programs. Many Nucor team members serve on KCC advisory committees, such as Electrical Engineering Technologies, Welding Technologies, Machine Tool Technologies Manufacturing Technologies and Computer Graphic Design Technologies.

"The constant exchange of ideas, procedures and protocols affords both Nucor and KCC the unique growing opportunities to stay current and provide opportunities for collaboration," Carlson said.

Thompson, who now lives in Henderson, Nevada, has published four books-- two memoirs and two works of fiction--between August 2016 and October 2019.&nbsp;

"When I think of community colleges, I think of the ways it allowed me to grow," Thompson said. "The professors I encountered at community colleges understand their role in the students’ lives. Many of them spoke about the school being a stepping-stone. They were very helpful and offered the guidance I needed to move forward and pursue my writing career."

In addition to a transfer degree from KCC, Thompson earned a bachelor’s degree in English from Governors State University. He also is involved in a day program for adults with intellectual disabilities where he is employed as an administrator.

Ramirez will graduate from KCC in 2022.

**Richard Frey** of Kankakee was nominated for the Ray Hartstein Trustee Achievement Award, which recognizes exemplary service by a currently serving board member at an ICCTA member college.&nbsp;
