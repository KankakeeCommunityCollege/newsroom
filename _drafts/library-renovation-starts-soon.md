The KCC Miner Memorial Library is being renovated over the next 10 months to become a new Student Success Center and Library.

“We’re very excited that the new space will provide students, faculty, and staff with spaces for collaboration and access to enhanced technologies,” said Tracy Conner, librarian.&nbsp; “It will be an innovative space of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, dedicated to teaching and learning.”

All library resources will still be available—just in different locations—during the renovation.

**Beginning Dec. 2:&nbsp;**Find most services in Room D212. Some materials will be available in Room D212, and the rest are stored elsewhere and available upon request.

The Student Success Center (including the library, tutoring services, and Instructional Technology & Faculty Development) is scheduled to open for Fall 2020.
