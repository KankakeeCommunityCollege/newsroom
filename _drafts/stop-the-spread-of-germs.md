Amid the worry and concern, please use common-sense preventive actions. They include: Stay home if youâ€™re sick, cover coughs and sneezes, clean frequently touched surfaces, and wash your hands often.

The Centers for Disease Control recommends washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available. More resources are on the CDC website.
