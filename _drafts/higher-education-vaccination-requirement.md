On Aug. 26, Illinois Gov. Pritzker announced new vaccine requirements for higher education students and employees, including KCC.

KCC is in the process of implementing these changes. Those who are vaccinated can complete KCC's verification form.

do not receive the vaccine, you must be tested for COVID-19 once per week when testing becomes available at KCC. The earliest date that KCC will be able to implement testing at the Riverfront Campus is Oct. 11. Testing will later expand to extension centers. That information will be communicated to students and employees as it becomes available. Weekly tests will be free.

Most KCC students who are vaccinated qualify for a free class from KCC. This is up to $495 which will be a credit on your account.&nbsp;[Read all details here](https://news.kcc.edu/2021/08/02/vaccinated-claim-a-free-class.html).
