Military culture is very prescriptive. \[Active-duty service members\] don’t have a lot of choices. Now they’re expected to know how to do everything.<br>“A dedicated space where veterans can hang out helps them to connect with people they know will understand them," Stevenson said.<br>![](/uploads/kendra-souligne-brad-lowrey-dsc0169--sm.JPG){: .float-image-right width="361" height="241"}The other advisor of the Veteran’s Association is Kendra Souligne, who also works in the college’s financial aid office.&nbsp;<br>“Kendra helps veterans use and understand their educational benefits,” Stevenson said. “She is their first contact, and plays such a critical role. Her assistance really sets the stage for veterans to succeed. Kendra usually brings them to the Veterans Center very soon after she first meets them in financial aid area.”<br>Shelterforce’s article also described the PhotoVoice project, which supports veteran participants in efforts to build connectedness, community and conversation through photography. In Fall 2018, former KCC student Robert Perez was featured in a Movember Foundation [article](https://us.movember.com/story/view/id/11759/) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG5J5SZe_vA&amp;feature=youtu.be) about PhotoVoice.&nbsp;<br>In addition to the Veterans Center, KCC offers a number of services for veterans, including a [Veteran’s Association](http://www.kcc.edu/students/studentlife/clubs/Pages/veterans.aspx) which is an approved chapter of [Student Veterans of America](https://studentveterans.org/), and [services offered through the Office of Financial Aid](http://www.kcc.edu/future/paying/fedstateaid/veteran-services/Pages).
