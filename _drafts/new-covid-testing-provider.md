<br>Free COVID-19 testing for KCC students will now be done by SHIELD Illinois.&nbsp;![](/uploads/2022/kcc-covid-19-testing250x130.jpg){: .float-image-right width="250" height="130"}&nbsp;

Illinoisâ€™ Governor requires higher education students who are on campus regularly to either be vaccinated against COVID-19 or to complete a weekly COVID-19 test. The college is following prescribed measures to ensure the order is followed.&nbsp;

Students who are not vaccinated can get a COVID-19 test at KCC or another reputable location. The deadline to submit results is 11:59 p.m. each Saturday.&nbsp;

When you complete the weekly test at KCC, the results are automatically shared with KCC. You do have to upload your results weekly if you get a COVID-19 test from another provider.

Details can be found at [coronavirus.kcc.edu](http://coronavirus.kcc.edu){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
