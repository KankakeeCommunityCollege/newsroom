Life Fitness, the company that outfitted the KCC FItness Center, has made a limited time offer of free at-home workouts to KCC students and staff.

"It's important while you are staying in place to keep exercising from home," said Donnie Denson, KCC's assistant athletic director. "They have offered some great tips and routines for everyone."

The free workout link is essentially a temporary free trial for our partners, said Life Fitness representative Justin Mundt. "It will eventually become subscription-based, but it will require action from you and you will not be auto-signed up."
