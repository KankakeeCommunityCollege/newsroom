In honor of [First-Generation Celebration Day Nov. 8](https://firstgen.naspa.org/engagement/first-generation-college-celebration/first-generation-college-celebration){: target="_blank"}, Kankakee Community College is sharing information about the [TRIO Student Support Services](http://www.kcc.edu/students/helpful/trio/Pages/default.aspx){: target="_blank"} program.<br>TRIO Student Support Services is an academic support program for students who are first-generation, income-eligible or disabled and plan to transfer to a 4-year college/university to pursue their baccalaureate degree.<br>A first-generation college student is someone whose parent(s)/legal guardian(s) have not completed a bachelor's degree.&nbsp;<br>“TRIO Student Support Services advisors help students research their chosen major at four-year institutions and help them select courses at KCC that align with that major,” said Keisha Smith, KCC’s Assistant Director, TRIO Student Support Services. &nbsp;“TRIO students follow an academic plan, which is called a Life Map, because it helps the student balance school, work, family and other things in life that impact student success.”&nbsp;<br>The program is funded by a grant from the U.S. Dept. of Education, so all of TRIO’s services are free. Those services include:<br>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Transportation to 4-year colleges/universities for campus visits<br>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Career coaching<br>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Financial literacy information<br>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Cultural field trips<br>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Workshops to enhance college success skills<br>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Transfer assistance with admissions applications, scholarships and housing; and<br>• &nbsp; &nbsp;A student center with computers, printers and a comfortable place to study.<br>To join the program, or for more information, visit [www.kcc.edu/trio](http://www.kcc.edu/students/helpful/trio/Pages/default.aspx){: target="_blank"}, or phone Keisha Smith, TRIO Student Support Services director, at 815-802-8474.<br>&nbsp;
