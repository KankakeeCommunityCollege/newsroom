KCC has begun a major renovation of the Miner Memorial Library

As the project gets underway, here are some details about what to expect.

* The library will be completely moved out of its current space by the end of the fall semester. Demolition will begin over the winter break.
* The library's temporary service point for Spring 2020 and Summer 2020 will be Room D212. Some material will be available in Room D212, and the rest will be available upon request, and stored elsewhere on campus.&nbsp;
* The renovated space is scheduled to open for the Fall 2020 semester as the Student Student Success Center.
* T![](/uploads/ssc-lower-level-copy.jpg){: .float-image-left width="349" height="178"}he Student Student Success Center will include the library, tutoring services, and Instructional Technology & Faculty Development.
