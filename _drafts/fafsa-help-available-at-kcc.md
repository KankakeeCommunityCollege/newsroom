Although the federal financial aid form FAFSA is having a bumpy rollout of the new version of the form, KCC is still helping students find aid and ways to fund college.

Both current students and prospective students are able to consult with KCC's Office of Financial Aid to file for aid.

"The FAFSA is used across the nation, and so applicants everywhere are affected," said Kendra Souligne, KCC's director of Financial Aid. "Even with the issues, we want to make sure students know we can help get the FAFSA submitted."

Souligne said members of the Financial Aid team are ready to help students and their families through any challenges.&nbsp;
