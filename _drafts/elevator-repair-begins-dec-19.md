![](/uploads/2022/out-of-order-250x208.jpg){: .float-image-right width="250" height="208"}KCC is completing essential updates to the West Elevator, beginning Dec. 19. It is expected to be closed until Jan. 6.

Use this [website with maps and alternate routes](http://www.kcc.edu/elevator2023){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to get to the R Building and other destinations.

Here are a few other notes regarding this project:

* All staircases will be open.
* You won't be able to pass through the hallway by the west staircase (next to west elevator). That staircase will be accessible from the south (Health Careers/M Building side).
* The entrance that faces the west elevator will be closed. The entrance to Arts & Sciences (R Building) a few feet away will be open.

We apologize for any inconvenience.&nbsp;
