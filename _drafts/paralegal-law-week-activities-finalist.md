As an award recipient, the program is acknowledged on the [ABA Law Day Award](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_education/awards/law-day-awards/2019-law-day-award-recipients/){: target="_blank"} website and will be included in the Law Day 2020 Planning Guide.<br>“Every activity we sponsored promoted the theme of ‘Free Speech, Free Press, Free Society,’” said Dr. Kristine Condon, KCC professor and Paralegal/Legal Assistant program coordinator. “From our panel discussion on Michael Beschloss’ ‘Presidents of War’ with presidential grandson Clifton Truman Daniel to our sponsorship of the Illinois Appellate Court hearing oral arguments at our historic Kankakee courthouse, we had a variety of family-friendly activities that promoted civics engagement.”<br>KCC’s Law Week activities were held in early May around Law Day, which helps foster an understanding of legal professions and celebrates the role of law in our society.<br>Other events included the annual Family Trivia Night benefiting Prairie State Legal Services and the second annual Passport to Civics Fair, where over 20 local community organizations and agencies offered information on their programs and services. In addition, the 2019 Law Week launched its first-ever “Decorate the Courthouse” competition, with 3D replicas of the county’s courthouse decorated by participating high schools on display in Miner Memorial Library. Law Week participants were encouraged to vote for their fan favorite on Facebook.<br>The Law Week Committee collaborates with judiciary and bar associations and the program advisory committee to develop activities, Condon noted.<br>KCC’s Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies program is approved by the American Bar Association. Two degrees are offered through KCC’s program, a two-year associate degree program for those who plan to immediately enter the workforce or to transfer into a four-year bachelor’s degree program and an advanced certificate for those already holding a bachelor’s degree.<br>The college has established partnership agreements for paralegal graduates with Calumet College of St. Joseph in Indiana, Governors State University in University Park, Illinois State University in Normal, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, and St. Mary-of-the-Woods in Indiana.<br>The 36 credit-hour advanced certificate program is designed for those who hold a bachelor’s degree to complete training in appropriate areas such as writing and relevant computer applications to enhance their college coursework.<br>Both programs in Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies include intensive training in writing and current technology, as well as a required internship at a law firm or other legal organization.&nbsp;<br>For more information on the Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies program at KCC, phone Condon at 815-802-8216 or email [kcondon@kcc.edu](mailto:kcondon@kcc.edu).
