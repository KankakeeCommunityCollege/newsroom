KCC is offering a free class during Fall 2021 to anyone who brings in their vaccination card and student ID.

"We want to do our part in the community to mitigate COVID," said Beth Nunley, KCC's vice president for business affairs. "Offering an incentive for the vaccine will help encourage our students to be better protected, as well as discount their tuition."

The free class is offered as a tuition credit at the time of registration. Maximum value: $495. The offer applies only to tuition and basic fees of $165 per credit hour. Additional fees (including lab fees, out-of-district fees and others) are not included. No cash back. Offered in-person only. Limit of one free class per student.

To redeem, the student must show his/her own original COVID-19 vaccination card and KCC student ID card. Electronic copies and duplicates are not accepted.

Students who have already registered and paid can follow the procedures above to receive a refund check.

The free class for vaccinated individuals is available only for KCC students enrolled in a credit class or developmental education class for the Fall 2021 semester. Dual credit, non-credit continuing education, adult basic education, and English as a second language classes are excluded. Employees and their dependents are also excluded.

The offer expires Dec. 1, 2021.

The college is paying for the incentive using funds from the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund.

Many classes will begin the week of Aug. 16. In addition to the full semester classes that meet for 16 weeks, KCC also offers classes that meet for 12 weeks and eight weeks. Some begin later in the fall.

KCC is returning to mostly in-person learning, while also offering some classes in online and "hybrid" formats. Hybrid courses are partially in-person and partially online.
