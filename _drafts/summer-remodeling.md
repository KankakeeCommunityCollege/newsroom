During the summer, beginning May 13, KCC's College Center and Auditorium will be remodeled.

The area to be closed during construction includes the College Center area, the Auditorium, lower level Cavs Corner, Food Service and the Cavalier Room. The suggested detour is to walk outside or go to the second floor.

The [Center for Equity, Diversity & Inclusion](https://www.kcc.edu/student-resources/edi/ "Center for Equity, Diversity &amp; Inclusion") and Student Life Office will be temporarily located at the far east end of the first floor during construction.

To reach Student Affairs, registration and advisement, enter the Welcome Center doors, and go to the right. Take the stairs or elevator to the second floor and follow the hallway to Student Affairs.

The remodeling project is expected to be complete by Aug. 16. Food Service plans to re-open on Monday, Aug. 19.

The Hammes Bookstore, located across from the Miner Memorial Library, will have beverages, snacks and dry food items. The hours are Monday - Thursday, 8:30 a.m. - 5 p.m. The Bookstore will be open Fridays, May 31, June 21 and July 5, 8:30 a.m. - 1 p.m.

KCC is closed on most Fridays from May 17 to July 26. For all dates when the college is closed, and holidays, visit the [academic calendar](https://www.kcc.edu/academics/calendar/ "Academic calendar").
