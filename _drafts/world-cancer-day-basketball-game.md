World Cancer Day is Saturday, Feb. 4, 2023.

![](/uploads/2022/world-cancer-basketball-200x200.jpg){: .float-image-right width="200" height="200"}KCC women's basketball head coach Meister and the Cavaliers will host a World Cancer Game on Saturday, Feb. 4 at 1 p.m. vs. Sauk Valley Community College. The KCC men will have a game at 3 p.m., also against Sauk Valley.

Meister and her family recently lost a brother-in-law and wonderful uncle, Jeff Hanson, to cancer. "Jeff was a true sports fan who loved and supported all sports, both men and women’s," Meister said.

"This foundation has been a big part of Jeff’s journey before and after his diagnosis," Meister said. "We are all affected in some way by this terrible disease and it’s our turn to give back.

"Our goal is to raise $500. We are up for the challenge and would love the community’s support for this wonderful cause."
