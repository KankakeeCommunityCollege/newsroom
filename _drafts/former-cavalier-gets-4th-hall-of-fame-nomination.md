For the fourth year in a row, former KCC basketball player LaMont Robinson has been [nominated](https://www.hoophall.com/news/naismith-memorial-basketball-hall-of-fame-announces-eligible-candidates-for-the-class-of-2021/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} alongside a number of NBA legends for the&nbsp;[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame](http://www.hoophall.com/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

Robinson–sometimes called "The Comedy King of Basketball," and "Showboat"–already was inducted into the American Basketball Hall of Fame (2019).

He transferred to Central State University. Robinson had a professional playing career of 28 years playing barnstorming basketball in over 75 countries and played in over 3,000 games with the Harlem Globetrotters and his own teams "ShowBoat" Robinson's Harlem Road Kings and "ShowBoat" Robinson's Harlem Clowns. He is shown at left with Meadowlark Lemon.

In a news release, Robinson said it is a great honor to be the only non-NBA player on this year's nominee list, which includes players like Paul Pierce, Michael Cooper, Doug Collins, Chris Webber, Lauren Jackson, Lou Henson and Swin Cash.

"I feel like I have already been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame," Robinson added. "Just being nominated not just once but for four years in a row is a blessing. I look at all the great players that played in the NBA that haven't even been nominated, so for me who didn't play in the NBA I am so honored and I owe a lot of this to coach Lehnus and his coaching.

Though event details are forthcoming, and the announcement timeline is subject to change, those selected to enter the Hall of Fame are slated to be unveiled in early April.
