<br>![](/uploads/llithumbnail.jpg){: .float-image-left width="226" height="130"}An information session for fall courses designed for active senior citizens will be 10 a.m. - noon Friday, Aug. 30 in the Iroquois Room at Kankakee Community College.&nbsp;

Registration and course information will be available. The event is free and open to the public.&nbsp;

There will be 12 classes offered exclusively to KCC Lifelong Learning Institute participants this fall. The classes are non-credit, continuing education, open to people ages 50 and older.&nbsp;

The classes focus on different intellectual and cultural topics, and are listed at [www.kcc.edu/LLI](http://www.kcc.edu/LLI).

“Taking classes for the joy of learning … no tests, no homework\!” said Linda Klette, a volunteer and president of the Lifelong Learning Advisory Committee. “What a perfect way to enjoy retirement.”

Sessions vary from a few hours to several meetings. Prices also vary, and many of the classes are $20 or less. &nbsp;&nbsp;

Directions are at [www.kcc.edu/directions/](http://www.kcc.edu/directions). To be on the program mailing list, email [mposing@kcc.edu](mailto:mposing@kcc.edu) or phone 815-802-8206.
