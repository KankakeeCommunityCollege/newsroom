**American Rescue Plan**

KCC received $3.2 million in financial assistance from the American Rescue Plan to pass directly to students like you. This money will go to Fall 2021 and Spring 2022 KCC students. To apply, you just have to be enrolled. Money will be distributed based on need and verification of enrollment. These awards do not impact your eligibility for other federal student aid, such as the Pell grant. These awards do not have to be paid back.

You can apply here: American Rescue Plan application.

Full details are at https://www.kcc.edu/tuition-and-aid/\#\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**One Workforce grant**

A new grant called One Workforce from the U.S. Department of Labor can pay for tuition, fees, books (and more) for students in many of KCC's manufacturing, welding and electrical engineering technology programs. To qualify, you must live in northeast Illinois or northwest Indiana, be 17 or older, not in high school, and unemployed or underemployed. People from underrepresented groups can also qualify. Even if you are already employed, you may be eligible.

This is an excellent opportunity to enroll for FREE in a program that leads to high paying jobs that are in demand\!

Learn more and get started: [skills.kcc.edu](http://skills.kcc.edu), [manderson@kcc.edu](mailto:manderson@kcc.edu), or phone 815-802-8873. The director of the program, Mark Anderson, will personally talk with you.
