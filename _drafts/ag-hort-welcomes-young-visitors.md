â€‹The Agri-Hort Technology program and the Horticulture Club hosted Mrs. Lubben's 4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;grade class from Manteno on Friday, April 29th. The grade school students learned about growing plants traditionally, in a hydroponics system, and in an aquaponics system. After starting in the classroom, they toured the greenhouse. The students finished up their field trip by creating their own science experiment to take home - plant a seed in potting mix and planting a seed in their own hydronics system.&nbsp;
