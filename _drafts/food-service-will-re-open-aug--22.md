KCC’s food service and cafeteria will remain closed until the start of fall classes on Aug. 22, 2022.

We apologize for any inconvenience.

The following sources are still available:&nbsp;<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; College Center, offering soda machines and microwave;<br>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Hammes Bookstore, offering snacks for sale; and<br>• &nbsp; &nbsp;KCC Food Pantry, offering a variety of options to students in Room L114, 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. Monday through Thursday.

The final food truck visit for the summer was July 21.
