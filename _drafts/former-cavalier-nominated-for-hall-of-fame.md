For the third year in a row, former KCC basketball player LaMont Robinson has been nominated alongside a number of NBA legends for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

Robinson--sometimes called "The Comedy King of Basketball," and "Showboat"--already was inducted into the American Basketball Hall of Fame (2019).

Robinson played for the Cavaliers under Coach Denny Lehnus during the 1981-82 season. He transferred to Central State University and played professionally for 28 years with the Harlem Globetrotters and other teams.

&nbsp; for playing professionally overseas and playing barnstorming basketball to over 75 countries and played in over 3,000 games with Harlem Globetrotter Legend the Great Meadowlark Lemon teams and with his own teams "ShowBoat" Robinson's Harlem Road Kings and "ShowBoat" Robinson's Harlem Clowns.&nbsp;

Robinson said this is such a great honor to be the only non-NBA player on this year list and to be in the company with such players like Kobe Bryant I feel like I have already been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, Robinson added &nbsp;just being nominated not just once but for three(3) years in a row is a blessing. I look at all the great players that played in the NBA that haven't even been nominated, so for me who didn't play in the NBA I am so honored and I owe a lot of this to coach Lehnus and his coaching. &nbsp;
