The recent vaccine mandate from Illinois Gov. Pritzker includes all higher education students and employees--including KCC.

Those who are vaccinated are asked to submit the [vaccination verification form](https://form.jotform.com/212384579044965){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} by the Sept. 19 deadline. If you already submitted your verification, thank you\!

![](/uploads/2021/vaccine-reminder-small.jpg){: .float-image-left width="150" height="150"}If you are not already vaccinated, please consider making an appointment this week to receive the first dose of a two-dose COVID-19 vaccination series or a single-dose vaccination by Sept. 19. Second doses of the vaccine must be received within 30 days after the first dose.

Please keep in mind, most KCC students who are vaccinated qualify for a free KCC class. This is up to a $495 value\! [Full details are here](https://news.kcc.edu/2021/08/02/vaccinated-claim-a-free-class.html).

Those who are not vaccinated by Sept. 19 must be tested weekly for COVID-19. KCC is working toward offering free on-site testing through a third-party vendor (saliva-based PCR tests). Details of how to follow the weekly testing protocol are in the works and will be communicated as soon as they are available.

We want to keep moving forward, and in this case, moving forward might not be simple. Thank you to students and employees for your understanding as we implement these required changes.

KCC will continue to keep information up-to-date on the&nbsp;[coronavirus.kcc.edu](http://coronavirus.kcc.edu) website. Please send questions using the&nbsp;[KCC Coronavirus contact us](https://coronavirus.kcc.edu/contact-us/) form.
