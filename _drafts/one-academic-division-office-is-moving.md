Effective Sept. 6, 2022, all of KCC's academic division offices will be in one location: Room W102.

Room W102 is on the first floor, in the Prairie Building (between Health Careers and the Technology and Innovation Center). See graphic or this [PDF of the first floor](/uploads/2022/First-floor-rev-5-22-W102-highlight.pdf) .

The academic divisions are:

* Business, Technology & Human Services
* Health Careers
* Humanities and Social Sciences

Two division offices are already in Room W102: Business, Technology & Human Services and Health Careers. Beginning Sept. 6, they will be joined by &nbsp;Humanities and Social Sciences--which is moving from Room L355.

Typical reasons students visit the division office are for schedule requests, general information about a program or help in communicating with a faculty member.
