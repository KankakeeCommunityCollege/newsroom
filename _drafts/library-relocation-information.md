The KCC Miner Memorial Library is being renovated over the next 10 months.

![](/uploads/rendering4-2.jpg){: .float-image-right width="399" height="224"}When it re-opens in Fall 2020, it will be a Student Success Center and Library.

During the renovation, all library resources are still available—just in different locations. Find most services in Room D212. Some materials are available in Room D212. The rest is stored elsewhere and available upon request.

Quiet Study Space is in Room L369 beginning in January.

“We’re very excited that the new space will provide students, faculty, and staff with spaces for collaboration and access to enhanced technologies,” said Tracy Conner, librarian.&nbsp; “It will be an innovative space of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, dedicated to teaching and learning.”
