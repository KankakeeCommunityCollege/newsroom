There are several ways for students to save a lot (or get **FREE TUITION**) by attending Kankakee Community College.&nbsp;

Details on the American Rescue Plan, One Workforce Grant, the Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act -- and more -- are here, and on the&nbsp;[attached flier](https://news.kcc.edu/uploads/pdf/Funds-Available-flier8-2-21.pdf).

**American Rescue Plan**

KCC received $3.2 million in financial assistance from the American Rescue Plan to pass directly to students. This money will go to Spring 2022 KCC students. To apply, you just have to be enrolled. Money will be distributed based on need and verification of enrollment. These awards do not impact a students' eligibility for other federal student aid, such as the Pell grant. These awards do not have to be paid back.

Use this link to apply:&nbsp;[American Rescue Plan application](https://form.jotform.com/212015939187964){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Full details are&nbsp;[here](https://coronavirus.kcc.edu/kcc-resources/#american-rescue-plan-arp-act){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.&nbsp;

**One Workforce Grant**

A new grant called One Workforce from the U.S. Department of Labor can pay for tuition, fees, books (and more) for students in many of KCC's manufacturing, welding and electrical engineering technology programs. To qualify, you must live in northeast Illinois or northwest Indiana, be 17 or older, not in high school, and unemployed or underemployed. People from underrepresented groups can also qualify. Even if you are already employed, you may be eligible.

Learn more and get started:&nbsp;[skills.kcc.edu](http://skills.kcc.edu/),&nbsp;[manderson@kcc.edu](mailto:manderson@kcc.edu), or phone 815-802-8873. The director of the program, Mark Anderson, will personally contact you.

&nbsp;The One Workforce Program is brought to you through a U.S. Department of Labor Grant and our partner, Calumet Area Industrial Commission.

**WIOA funding**

Through the the Workforce Innovation & Opportunity Act, there is funding available for career training in specific degree and training programs. Support includes books, supplies and transportation. If you are eligible, an appointment will be set up with a career counselor to determine your scholarship funding.
