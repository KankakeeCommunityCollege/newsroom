The Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Center Fund fosters community-building, and provides resources and a safe, inclusive and affirming space for the entire campus community. The Emergency Assistance Fund supports KCC students experiencing an extreme financial hardship that threatens to halt their education.&nbsp;<br><br>“We want to thank our generous donors who supported Give Day\!” said Kelly Myers, executive director of the KCC Foundation. “Together, we raised $39,565. This day of giving provided essential support that will increase the success of our students. Together we really are strong\!”&nbsp;<br><br>More information, updates and opportunities to support KCC students, are online at foundation.kcc.edu/.<br>&nbsp;
