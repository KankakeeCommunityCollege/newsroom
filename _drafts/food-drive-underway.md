![Feed the Need logo](/uploads/2023/feed-the-need-220x260.jpg "Feed the Need"){: width="220" height="260"}The **Feed the Need Food Drive** is underway until Nov. 30 at KCC.

The Illinois Community Colleges Feed the Need Food Drive supports those experiencing food insecurity within our communities and KCC students.

**Our Goal:** We aim to collect **\[Goal Amount\]** of non-perishable food items. Your support can help us achieve this and make a real difference.

**Drop-off Locations:** Donations can be made at:

* **\[Location 1\]**
* **\[Location 2\]**
* **\[Location 3\]**

The final day of the food drive will be Nov. 30.

Food insecurity is a pressing issue, affecting **1 in 3 college students nationwide,** according to the Hope Center for College, Community, and Justice. By participating in this drive, we can help ensure that no student goes hungry.

Thank you for your enthusiasm and support!

The Illinois Community Colleges Feed the Need Food Drive aims to support those experiencing food insecurity within our communities and on our own campus.
