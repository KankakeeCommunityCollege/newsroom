For the remainder of the summer term the Food Pantry has created two different grab and go food packs for students.&nbsp;

![](/uploads/gng-food-sm.png){: .float-image-left width="350" height="262"}The first will be a snack pack of three snack items, the second will be a lunch pack with a shelf stable lunch item and two snacks.&nbsp; All are packaged in clear bags so students can see what they are getting when they select a bag.

Grab & Go food will be available in W102 and the Welcome Center from 8-6 p.m.,&nbsp; Monday â€“ Friday.
