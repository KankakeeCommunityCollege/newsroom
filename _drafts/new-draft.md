*Editor’s note: This press release from Olivet Nazarene University details a new partnership with KCC.*

![Leadership, Excellence Army ROTC emblem](/uploads/2023/army-rotc-logo219x300.jpg "Army ROTC Emblem"){: width="219" height="300"}Olivet Nazarene University is proud to announce a new partnership with Kankakee Community College to offer students an exceptional opportunity to pursue a commission as an Army officer through dual enrollment. This collaboration provides students with streamlined admission, coordinated course planning, and access to facilities and services from both KCC and ONU.

This partnership is designed to help students save money and transition smoothly from their early coursework at KCC to the completion of their four-year degree at ONU, along with their Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) studies. The program culminates in military commissioning as a second lieutenant.

KCC students can enjoy dual enrollment status for their first two years of ROTC, then transfer to ONU to earn a bachelor’s degree with a minor in military science and complete their ROTC leadership training.

Capt. Ryan Hutton, Class of 2016 physical education graduate, shared his experience: “I am currently a Field Artillery Officer. I would not have had this opportunity if it was not for the hardworking men and women of the Roaring Tiger Battalion. You will receive some of the greatest instruction in the ways of the military.”

Capt. Kathleen Hartsell, a Class of 2012 nursing graduate, also highlighted the benefits of the program: “I first became interested in the Army when I was a junior in high school. I knew I wanted to be a nurse but needed financial help to achieve my goal. After graduating high school, I joined Olivet’s Army ROTC program and received a full-ride nursing scholarship. The Army has allowed me to travel the world, receive the best medical training, and complete a master’s degree.”

Army ROTC offers a variety of scholarship options, including two-year awards that provide 100% tuition and fees annually or room and board up to $12,000, which students may qualify for once they transfer to ONU.

To begin the Army ROTC dual enrollment process, please contact a KCC academic advisor by emailing or by calling 815-802-8500.
