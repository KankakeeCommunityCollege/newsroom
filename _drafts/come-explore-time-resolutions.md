Faculty members at Kankakee Community College will explore the&nbsp; The calendar turned to 2024, and millions of people embarked on the annual tradition of setting New Year resolutions.

On Tuesday, Jan. 30, from 2-3 p.m. in KCC Room L355 for an interdisciplinary discussion about time and resolutions.&nbsp;



* Why do people make resolutions in January?
* What is it about a "new year" that prompts this?
* How do we perceive time, and how does it impact our sense of self?
* How does it impact our mental health?



We'll discuss these questions and more! KCC faculty members Ken West, Jenny Pecora, Keith Stevenson, Nate Ulrich and Cari Stevenson will explore these topics from their respective disciplines (Philosophy, English, Physical Science, and Psychology).

Students, staff, and faculty are welcome to join the discussion!
